<h1>Hoops Time Machine</h1>
<div class="game">
<p> As a companion to the documentary "The Last Dance" on Netflix; the infamous, 
mercurial, and elusive, author of the cult blog <a href="www.passionofronartest.blogspot.com">
The Passion of Ron Artest </a> has come out of retirement to 
put together a curated list of his airness Michael Jordan's pivotal playoff games.
</p>

<div class="taster">
<p>
Along the way some of the Elusive Passion chef's complements and insights 
have been thrown in to provide additional historical context. These contributions
are written in an oblique font.

Whether you watched these
games live or are seeing them for the first time you will certainly 
enjoy hopping in the time machine and seeing how the league and network television evolved
over a 20 year period. We start from the '86 Celtic team taken to the brink 
as a young Michael runs circles around them, and journey 
through the mid 90s. Where we see the network hype surrounding  
the television premier of Jurassic Park and Bob Dole doing Visa commericals
the hoops time machine has something for everyone. Let the journey begin.

<div class="game">
<h2> 1986 Celtics Round 1 Game 2:"Tell your boy DJ I got something for him." </h2>
<p> Bull's management's had a reasonable plan. They hoped to 
nurse a young Michael Jordan, who represented the future of the entire franchise, back slowly
and cautiously from a broken foot suffered earlier in the regular season. 
If that meant missing out on the playoffs all the better. They weren't contenders that year
and they could take a higher draft pick as they built for the future. 
Jordan had other ideas. He blitzed through his
rehab, and forced his way back into the team, single handedly hauling 
the Bulls into the playoffs as the eighth seed to face one of the
greatest teams of all time. I can't imagine Jerry Krause was thrilled.
Having taken it on the chin in game 1 of the series Michael game back with a legendary performance:

</div>

<div class="taster">
Note the pained expressions on the faces of Dennis Johnson, Larry Bird, Bill Walton,
and the rest of the Boston Team, coaching staff, and supporters, 
as they contend with a force of nature summoned from the void. 
</div>

By way of epilogue we mention Boston went on to win the NBA championship that year. 
After the final game of the championship series the story goes that Larry Bird and Bill 
Walton stayed up all night crushing a bottle of Wild Turkey in Larry's kitchen.

<div class="game">
<h2> Bulls Pistons Game 5 1990: In which our Hero Fails</h2>
<p> 
Isiah Thomas is fond of pointing out that everyone talks about the 80s and 90s like
it was just the Lakers, Celtics, and the Bulls. But Detroit won back to back championships
right in the middle of all that and they weren't going to let Michael walk to a coronation.
With Aguirres, Rodman, and Laimbeer as bigs, and Thomas and Dumars in the back court
the Pistons were formidable opposition and overcoming them was probably the biggest obstacle the
Bulls dynasty would have to overcome.

</div>


<div class="taster">
<p>
Joe Dumars would later become GM of the Pistons assembling their 2004 championship winning team. 
There are some interesting similarities between the two Championship teams with Billups/Hamilton
in the Dumar/Thomas Mold and Aguirres and Rodman playing similar roles to the Wallace Bros. 
</p>

<p>
The broadcast also features an advert for that summer's concerts at the Palace at Auburn Hills.
The lineup included Phil Collins, Janet Jackson, and David Bowie. There was also
a "restore the roar" campaign for the Detroit Lions. The roar has yet to be restored.
True aficianados can follow this up with Game 6 of the same series.

<div class="game">
<h2>1991 Eastern Conference Finals Game 3 Bulls v Pistons: Ascendants vs Champions</h2>
<p>
Things are reaching their heated peak between the Bulls and the Pistons.
The hype surrounding this game is that Aguirre told Pippen to "meet him in the parking lot" after
Game 2. Also worth watching is the Costas and Pat Riley pre game show and at half time where 
Riley is talking about potentially taking over as Knicks head coach. A mock draft
introduces us to a number of players that will feature, to varying degrees, 
in the coming years. Amongst them Brian Williams; on a strange 
note we may reflect that from this mock draft Brian Williams would change his name
to Bison Dele and a decade later he will have disappeared presumed murdered at sea. 

This video is a full cut with
all the trimmings including classic McDonalds and ArmorAll ads. 
You can't help but feel the world was objectively a better place in 1991:

<h2> 1991 NBA Finals Game 3: Magic</h2>
<p>
With their Detroit nemesis vanquished only the Lakers and Magic Johnson stood in the way
of the Bulls' first championship.
</p>

<div class="taster">
<p>
Although Michael is now unstoppable Magic Johnson provides some vintage moments:
combining a genius IQ level post game with the oldest school passing clinic
you will ever see. Vlade Divac also sparked a cigarette at halftime of this game;
further evidence of the increased sophistication of the early nineties.

<h2>1992 Game 6: Portland Trail Blazers </h2>
<p>
Jordan got fired up to play Drexler and the Blazers.
Here they are closing out their second championship:

<div class="game">
<h2> 1993 Game 3 New York Knicks @ Bulls </h2>
<p>
Now we get into the real grinding beauty of 1990s ball. 
The teams out west may have been slightly more progressive, perhaps easier on the eye,
but Ewing and Oakley, Doc, Mason and Starks are all now part of New York legend. Pat Riley has
also decided to personally challenge Warren Zevon's Werewolf of London for "most perfect
hair" award.

</div>

<p>
This game, along with the ads, is another deep dive immersive experience. One of the lessons 
that the authors of this hoop time travel journey learned was that Athlete's foot and Miller Lite
were both a much bigger deal in the 90s.
</p>
</div>


<div class="game">
<h2>1993 Game 5 New York Bulls @ Knicks </h2>
<p>
The biggest game in Madison Square Gardens since the 70s. So you know it's time to 
get fired up. If you've come this far in the time machine you might have noticed you
are developing a kind of Pavlovian association with the roundball rock theme song. 
It's a bit like the click that a seasoned drinker feels upon cracking open a cold beer.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_h7Lm7C9Nk"> Here </a> is 
a symphonic version along with its origin story as described by composer John Tesh.
</p>

<p>
Now to the game. Jordan came off some relatively "uninspired" hangover 
games early in the series to drop 54 in Chicago. He had popped down to Atlantic
city for a little action in the Casino and the media, it is fair to say,
had a field day. 
</p>

<p>
Jordan has decided he's done talking to the press for a while
and the series is finely poised.
This entertaining tilt is a big game for Pippen. Ewing and Cartwright 
go head to head for long stretches. The final play of this game encapsulates how
the Bulls won six championships. It is probably one of the most incredible defensive sequences
you will see in basketball.

<h2> Suns Sonics 1993 Game 5: A Small Detour Out West</h2>
<p>
To set up the finals we'll take a small peak at what the game is like out west.
Sir Charles is always full value for money and there are a few other real characters 
in this series including the future Mayor of Sacramento Kevin Johnston. 
Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton form a dynamic duo and we'll run into them again a little 
later down the road.

<a href="https://majerles.com/"> Dan Majerle's restaurant </a>

<h2> Bulls and Suns NBA Finals Game 4 </h2>
<p>
Michael and Charles meet in the finals. The Bulls are going for three in a row and
Charles is the league's MVP. To get an idea of where the leauge is at at this stage
this video is worth a watch:

The quality of the league's stars and the impact the NBA makes abroad took a big
boost after the Dream Team at the Olympics in Barcelona.

<h2> 1994 Bulls/Knicks: The Baseball Years </h2>
<p>
Jordan took a step back from basketball, personal tragedy, and the madness to hang out
with Terry Francona and hit the road with the double AA Barons (a baseball team).
The NBA decided to continue operating despite this decision. 
The Bulls were also keeping at it with Scottie Pippen taking the reigns.
We get a fair insight into what Michael Jordan brings when he isn't
there and that is why we'll include a couple games from this series. 
The first is a clip of the infamous
"Scottie asked out" game:
</p>

<div class="embed">
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZhupKWCsEU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>
To be fair to Pippen, he was supposed to be the man now, and then, with the 
game on the line, the coach draws up a play for a Rookie? 
It may well have been that a few lingering frustrations just boiled
over in Pippen's head and he walked. Toni drains the game winning shot giving way
to the angriest team you will ever see walking off the floor having just won a playoff
game with a buzzer beater. 
</p>

<div class="taster">
<p>
It would take a heart of stone not to be moved by 
the story that Bill Cartwright broke down in tears in the dressing
room after that game telling Scottie he couldn't believe he had walked out on them.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The final game of the series was a tense affair. The Knicks'
had to do it this time and the Bulls
players all wanted to prove they could do it without Michael.
