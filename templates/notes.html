<h2> Notes </h2>
<p>
Here is a small collection of notes on a variety of topics. These are in varying
states of completion and correctness. Please contact me if you find any glaring errors. This
page is updated periodically with new notes and modifications to old ones. Ultimately I would
like some of these notes to become interactive although this might be a little bit ambitious. 
Any <samp>.svg</samp> file is probably not going to be rendered properly by your browser 
so probably better to download the linked file and 
open with a program like <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a>.

<ul>
{% for note in notes %}
  <li> <a href="{{url_for('download_file', filename=note)}}">{{note}}</a> </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h2> Web Notes </h2>
<p>
Configuring Mac/Linux Environments collects some useful tips on configuring ssh servers, 
apache2 servers for hosting flask applications, configuring vimrc
files, and common patterns in Git.
The TensorFlow notes mainly deal with installation instructions and ways to build models
with <samp>tf.contrib.learn</samp>, I'm trying to incorporate batch_normalization in a 
straightforward way at the moment without having to rebuild my models from scratch.

The Quaternions page is under construction but will be a condensed treatment of quaternions with 
some visualizations and web based tools to explore their application in rotations and special
relativity. (Currently the page consists of a poem written by William Rowan Hamilton).
