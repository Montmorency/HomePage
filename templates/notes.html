<h1> Notes and Teaching </h1>
<p>
Here is a small collection of writing and presentations on a variety of topics. These are in varying
states of completion and correctness. Please contact me if you find any glaring errors. This
page is updated periodically with new notes and modifications to old ones. Ultimately I would
like some of these notes to become interactive.
Any <samp>.svg</samp> file is probably not going to be rendered properly by your browser 
so probably better to download the linked file and open with a program 
like <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a>.
</p>
<ul class=file_list>
{% for note in notes %}
  <li> <a href="{{url_for('download_file', filename=note)}}">{{note}}</a> </li>
{% endfor %}

<h2> Web Notes </h2>
<p>
Configuring Mac/Linux Environments collects some useful tips on using package managers, 
configuring ssh servers, configuring vimrc files, and common patterns in Git.
</p>
<p>
Web Frameworks and Servers contains some configurations notes on 
using apache2 servers for hosting flask applications, 
</p>
<p>
The TensorFlow notes mainly deal with installation instructions and ways to build models
with <samp>tf.contrib.learn</samp>. Also some early attempts I made to incorporate batch_normalization in a 
straightforward way. The package is rapidly evolving so those notes are probably already obsolete.

<p>
  The Quaternions page is under construction but will be a condensed treatment of quaternions with 
some visualizations and web based tools to explore their application in rotations and special
relativity. (Currently the page consists of a poem written by William Rowan Hamilton).

<p>
Also under construction is a little page on common sorting algorithms and
data structures. There are some visualizations based on <samp>d3.js</samp>
to try and understand them a little better.
