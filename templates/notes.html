<h2> Notes </h2>
<p>
Here is a small collection of notes on a variety of topics. These are in varying
states of completion and correctness. Please contact me if you find any glaring errors. This
page is updated periodically with new notes and modifications to old ones. Ultimately I would
like some of these notes to morph into an actual subdomain of the site where the text becomes
interactive although this might be a little bit ambitious. Any <samp>.svg</samp> file is probably
not going to be rendered properly by your browser so probably better to download the linked file
and open with a program like <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/"> Inkscape </a>.
</p>

<ul>
{% for note in notes %}
  <li> <a href="{{url_for('download_file', filename=note)}}"> {{note}} </a> </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h2> Web Notes </h2>
This page, which perhaps should be split into multiple pages, collects some useful tips
on configuring ssh servers, apache2 servers for hosting flask applications, configuring vimrc
files, and common patterns in Git.
<ul>
<li><a href="{{url_for('environment')}}"> Configuring Mac/Linux Environments </a></li>
</ul>

This page is under construction but will be a condensed treatment of quaternions with 
some visualizations and web based tools to explore their application in rotations and special
relativity. (currently consists of a poem written by William Rowan Hamilton).
<ul>
<li><a href="{{url_for('quaternions')}}"> Quaternions </a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Essays</h2>
<p> Romulus Magazine: <a href="https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/sites/wolfson.ox.ac.uk/files/romulus_magazine_2015_web.pdf"> Thermodynamics and Arcadia. </a></p>
