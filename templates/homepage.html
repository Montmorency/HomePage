<h1> Henry Lambert</h1>
<p>
I am a materials scientist with a particular interest in applying 
computational techniques to understanding how the composition of a material
at its atomic scale leads to its observable properties at the macroscopic scale. 
Essentially, I am interested in how particular arrangements of atoms 
lead to the electronic or elastic properties of a semiconductor or a piece of steel.

I formerly worked in King's College London with the late
<a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/physics/people/academicstaff/devita.aspx"> Alessandro De Vita </a>. 
We were focused on fracture processes in <a href="https://www.hems.ox.ac.uk"> hydrogen embrittled steels </a>:
a phenomenon of substantial interest to materials engineers.

Before joining King's I developed computational techniques for calculating 
the bandgaps of semiconducting materials in 
<a href="http://giustino.materials.ox.ac.uk"> Feliciano Giustino's group </a>.

<p>
My overarching interests in materials science are density functional theory, electronic correlation
and Haydock's recursion method. The latter provides an interesting link to fundamental
techniques in computer science which I am always interested in exploring further. 

Most of the development work I have done is in Python, C, Fortran, and Haskell. Recently,
I have become interested in browser based data visualization techniques based on javascript.
