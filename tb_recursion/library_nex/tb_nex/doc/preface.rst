  THE RECURSION SUBROUTINE LIBRARY CONTAINS ROUTINES TO ENABLE THE

COMPUTATION OF THE  INTEGRATED  DENSITY OF STATES AND INTEGRALS OF

AN ARBITRARY  FUNCTION TIMES THE DENSITY OF STATES TO BE EFFECTED.

THE  APPROPRIATE  HAMILTONIANS  ARE THOSE FOR A FINITE (60 - 6000)

CLUSTER OF ATOMS WITH N ORBITALS ( 1 - 10 OR MORE) AND 'NEIGHBOUR'

INTERACTIONS , GIVING  AN EFFECTIVE  LARGE , SPARSE  MATRIX EIGEN-

PROBLEM FOR WHICH IS  REQUIRED  THE  DISTRIBUTION  OF  EIGENVALUES

CORRESPONDING TO THE  LOCAL DENSITY OF STATES. THE  MATHEMATICS OF

THE  RECURSION  METHOD  IS  DESCRIBED  IN  HEINE, HAYDOCK, KELLY &

BULLETT (1) AND OF THE COMPUTATION OF INTEGRALS IN NEX (2).  FOR A

DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  BASIC  MATHEMATICAL  ROUTINES  SEE  NEX (3),

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FEW ADDITIONAL SPECIALISED  ROUTINES INCLUDED

IN THIS COLLECTION.

  TWO INDEPENDANT PARAMETERS AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE USER, GIVING A

CONTROL ON THE  ACCURACY , ARE THE  SIZE OF THE  CLUSTER  AND  THE

'NUMBER OF LEVELS' IN  THE  RECURSION. THE  APPROPRIATE  VALUES OF

THESE  PARAMETERS WILL VARY FROM  PROBLEM TO PROBLEM  DEPENDING ON

THE HAMILTONIAN, THE  NATURE OF THE  LATTICE, AND OF THE  PHYSICAL

QUANTITY  OF  INTEREST  ULTIMATELY  BEING  COMPUTED, AND SHOULD BE

DETERMINED BY SOME TRIAL RUNS OF THE PROGRAM. FOR FIVE D-ELECTRONS

PER SITE IN FCC AND BCC CLUSTERS AND THE CALCULATION OF STRUCTURAL

ENERGIES IT HAS BEEN  FOUND THAT THE NUMBER OF LEVELS  APPROPRIATE

IS  2-5 TIMES THE 'RADIUS' OF THE CLUSTER (IN NUMBERS OF ATOMS) IN

CUBOID  CLUSTERS . A  MATHEMATICALLY  EXACT  ERROR  BOUND  ON  THE

INTEGRATED   DENSITY  OF  STATES   IS  AVAILABLE   IF  ONLY  EXACT

COEFFICIENTS ARE USED , BUT , AS IS THE NATURE OF SUCH QUANTITIES,

THIS  BOUND IS  PESSIMISTIC , USUALLY  BY  AT  LEAST  AN  ORDER OF

MAGNITUDE.
