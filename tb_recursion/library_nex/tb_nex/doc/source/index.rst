NOTE
====
  THIS LIBRARY OF PROGRAMS FOR THE RECURSION METHOD WAS WRITTEN BY CHRIS
NEX AND IS MADE AVAILABLE AT NO COST.  CHRIS AND I ONLY ASK THAT USERS
ACKNOWLEDGE THE RECURSION LIBRARY WHEN IT HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION
TO THEIR WORK, AND THAT THEY NOTIFY ME OF ANY ERRORS THEY DISCOVER.  I
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE USERS TO CONSULT WITH ME BEFORE EMBARKING ON LARGE PROJECTS
TO AVOID THE PITFALLS OTHERS HAVE ENCOUNTERED AND TO AVOID DUPLICATION OF
EFFORT.
  PLEASE ENJOY THE OPPORTUNITIES THESE PROGRAMS OFFER.
