Specification of Subroutines
=============================

.. f:subroutine:: RECAL(HOP,PSI,PMN,M,A,B2,LL)

  Computes the tri-diagonalization of a large sparse symmetric matrix
  using the recursion (or Lanczos or Paige's) method:

  DIMENSION PSI(M), PMN(M), A(LL), B2(LL)

  .. math::

    a_n = <\psi_{n},H \psi_{n}> \\
    b_{n+1}\psi_{n+1} = (H-a_{n})\psi_{n} - b_{n}\psi_{n-1}\\
    <\psi_{n+1},\psi_{n+1}> = 1


  This routine must be accompanied by a routine segment hop to carry
  out the steps of this process.

.. f:subroutine:: RECSUM(AC,BC,NA,LL,NP,A,B2,EPS,WK,NW)

	Computes the tridiagonalisation (continued fraction, Jacobi matrix)
	corresponding to the sum of NP tridiagonalisations :math:`w_{m}(x)`.

	.. math::

     \sqrt{b_{n+1,m}} P_{n+1,m}(x) = (x-a_{n,m})P_{n,m}(x)-\sqrt(b_{n,m})P_{n-1,m}(x)
     w(x) = \sum_{m=1}^{NC} b(0,m) w_{m}(x)

	DIMENSION AC(NA,NP),BC(NA,NP),WK(NW),A(NA),B(NA)
  AC    AC(N,M) = A(N-1,M),  N=1,M,  M=1,NP
  BC    BC(N,M) = B(N-1,M)**2,  N=1,LL,  M=1,NP

.. f:subroutine:: TERMGN (A,B2,LL,EPS,ERR,ITMX,AA,RNG,WB,NBP1,AM,BM2,IC,WK,NW,BWK,NBD,IWK)

    Generates an analytic terminator to a given continued fraction. The form of the
    terminator is a sum of square roots of quadratics, F(E), as in :f:subr:`DENCRS`, 
    with parameters to be adjusted to match the apparent bands gaps in the given
    continued fraction. The local weight (as calculated in :f:subr:`RECWT` of F(E)
    is matched to that of the given continued fraction (A(I), B2(I)) at E values
    in the Neighbourhood of band edges and local minima. This routine may
    serve as an example for the matching of other forms of terminating function
    or matching algoirithms.

.. f:subroutine:: MMCAL(CRD,NDIM,NAT,NN,ND,NM,EV,IZP,NMAT,MM,VEC,IW)

  Computes an index of distinct vectors linking neighbouring sites
  in a given lattice. The vectors are computed and indexed according to
  the 'type' (as defined by IZP) of the terminal atoms as well as by the
  vector components. Thus if there are 3 types of atoms linked in all
  pair combinations by equivalent vectors, all combinations will occur
  in the index. (i.e. 12 entries including both senses of the vector)
  if any of the 'types' in IZP are negative, it is assumed that
  MMCAL has already been called for a subcluster of the current cluster
  and that those atoms with negative izp are new additions whose
  interactions are to be computed (see :f:subr:`ADDAT` for an example of this
  usage).

  continued fraction (J-Matrix) at a given point :math:`E` and returns that value
  and also quadrature nodes and weights at a set of points bounded above by
  EMX. The table of values TB is output so that the integrated density of states,

  based on the number, weights and positions of separate bands using

  root band edges may be generated using :f:subr:`CFGPGN` or :f:subr:`TERGEN`
  and should be of the same length as the original.

  of levels such that it does not recompute earlier polynomial
  values. If required the value of the last coefficient, A(LL),
  may be computed, or it may be assumed that this has already been
  done and that value used in the calculation of the weight.
  The expression for the weight used is (with N=LL).

  W1*    SQRT(B(0,0))*W0 : THE STARTING VECTORS OF THE
         RECURRENCE (UNNORMALISED).THE FIRST SUBSCRIPT RUNS
         OVER THE VECTOR COMPONENTS AND THE SECOND OVER THE
         PERTURBATION SERIES.
  W0*    W(-1,K) THE NORMALISED (-1) STARTING VECTORS STORED AS W1
  A*     OUTPUT AS THE ARRAY OF A COEFFICIENTS , THE FIRST SUBSCRIPT
         RUNNING OVER THE  RECURRENCE RELATION AND THE SECOND OVER THE
         PERTURBATION SERIES.
  B*     THE SQRT(B(N,0)*B(N,K)) COEFFICIENTS STORED AS THE AS.
         B(1,K) MUST BE SET AND CONSISTENT WITH W1.
  NW     DIMENSION OF MATRICES H AND V
  LLIM   LENGTH OF PERTURBATION SERIES REQUIRED.
  NA     FIRST DIMENSION OF ARRAYS A AND B
  NL     NO. OF 'LEVELS' IN THE RECURRENCE
  AMAT*  WORK ARRAY OF AT LEAST LLIM*LLIM ELEMENTS


.. f:subroutine:: BCCLAT(CRD,NDIM,IZP,NAT,NX,NY,NZ,NTYPE)

  Generates a BCC lattice on a positive integer grid, enclosed by
  a cuboid of a given size.

  ARGUMENTS:( * INDICATES AN OVERWRITTEN ARGUMENT)
  CRD*    LATTICE COORDINATES ((I,J),I=1,3),J=1,NAT
  NDIM    FIRST FIRST DIMENSION OF ARRAY COORD >OR= 3
  IZP*    INTEGER*2 ARRAY RETURNING THE VALUE NTYPE IN EACH ELEMENT
  NAT*    ON INPUT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LATTICE POINTS ALLOWED
          ON OUTPUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF POINTS GENERATED
          NX,NY,NZ  INTEGER DIMENSIONS OF THE CUBOID TO CONTAIN THE LATTICE
          NTYPE   'TYPE' CODE FOR EACH LATTICE SITE


.. f:function:: BCCBFE(I,J,R2,DD)

  Determines whether a distance is a 'nearest neighbour' or 'next nearest neighbour'
  distance in the BCC lattice generated by :f:subr:`BCCLAT`, and if so outputs the DD 
  parameters for iron according to D.G. Pettifor. 

  ARGUMENTS :
  I   'TYPE' OF ONE LATTICE SITE
  J   'TYPE' OF THE OTHER LATTICE
  R2   SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO LATTICE SITES
  DD*  OUTPUT AS THE DD PARAMETERS OF D.G.PETTIFOR (SIGMA,PI,DELTA)
       AND DD(11)=0.0 OF R2<1.0E-4 AS THE SELF ENERGY
       BCCBFE TAKES THE VALUE 0 IF THE SITES ARE NOT NEIGHBOURS
       AND 1 IF THEY ARE NEIGHBOURS
