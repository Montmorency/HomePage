\chapter{Metallurgy}
  Cottrell noted that metallurgy would require a "theory... which explains
the properties of metallic solids and the explanation of the origin of this
structure from the structures of individual atoms." 

Similarly Heine noted "What we lack is a fundamental quantum 
theory of the cohesion and structure of a wide diversity of solids." 

One of the main thrusts of this, increasingly misnamed note, is that the route
to a comprehensive framework for a quantum theory of cohesion must come
from a mathematically rigorous description of electronic structure based
on the local atomic environment.

Early work on DOS of alloys \cite{cubiotti77}. Wannier functions means that the hybridisation problem
is eliminated. The Wannier functions are chosen to minimize across the band structure range so hybridisation effects
should be included..
