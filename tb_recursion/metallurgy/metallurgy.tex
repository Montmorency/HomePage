\chapter{Metallurgy}
\label{chap:metallurgy}
\section{Introduction}
Cottrell observed that metallurgy would require a ``theory... which explains
the properties of metallic solids and the explanation of the origin of this
structure from the structures of individual atoms." Similarly in Vol. 35
Heine noted "What we lack is a fundamental quantum theory of the cohesion
and structure of a wide diversity of solids." The previous chapters,
though hopefully enjoyable in their own right, were really just meant to bring
us to the stage where we can start using the principles of locality
and recursion methods to compute the structural and 
mechanical properties of extended solids.

This chapter will focus on the calculation of the electronic and mechanical
properties of transition metals and their alloys. 

%Perhaps the most interesting aspect of physical metallurgy is how
%macroscopic parameters can be directly connected to the solution of 
%the wave equation governing the atomic scale motion of the electrons.

It is worthwhile reviewing some of the highlights from the history
of first principles calculations of material properties.

The analysis of Wigner and Seitz in many ways initiated the field
of theoretical materials science with their calculation of the cohesive
energy and lattice constant of metallic sodium\cite{wigner33, wigner34}.

Subsequent work in this field extended Wigner and Seitz analysis
to the cohesive and elastic properties of monovalent
metals like sodium, lithium, and copper \cite{fuchs36}. Around
the same time the young quantum theory was being
used to explain the appearance of different phases in alloys in terms 
of Brillouin zones \cite{bethe29, bouckhaert36, owen33, jones34}. 

Born's work provides the standard treatment of 
the stability of lattices to short and long wavelength
vibrations considering general forms for the interatomic potentials\cite{born40,born42},
with other workers again making extensions of the theory to particular
lattice types \cite{power41, nabarro52}. The work of Brockhouse and
others on neutron spectroscopy provided striking experimental confirmation
of many of the predicted properties of lattice vibrations.

In keeping with the unifying theme of the book the targeted quantities
will first be described and formulated in general terms and then mapped
on to a set of recursion calculations to compute the cohesive and elastic
properties of a material from the perspective of the local atomic environment.

\section{Crystal Structure}
Step number uno in the field of theoretical metallurgy is a theory that correctly
describes the crystal structures formed by different pure metals. 
Often the first three lattices encountered by students of metallurgy 
will be FCC, HCP, and BCC.

\begin{quote}
‘Close-packing’ lacks a unique meaning without a specification of 
what is being packed, and what is meant by close and, in particular, 
what is close to what. The thinking underlying the citation of f.c.c. 
and h.p.c. as examples of closest-packed structures is the packing of 
equal hard spheres. A metal is not an assembly of hard spheres,but rather of 
nuclei and electrons.These are both corpundular, with nowhere vanishing 
wavefunctions, but because of their very large mass ratio it is an excellent 
approximation to consider the nuclei as located at points
but the electrons as forming a continuum, with density throughout the metal 
everywhere positive and, except close to the nuclei, quasi-uniform.
\end{quote}

The closeness of close packed structures stems from trying to squeeze
the largest number of atoms into a particular volume
with a hard lower bound on the approach of the Nucleii.
The BCC structure solves a different problem in that it finds a
distribution of nuclei likely to be closest to the electrons.

Early considerations based on orbital hybridisation and geometry
were performed by Altmann, Coulson, and Hume-Rothery who treated 
the problem in Ref.~\cite{altmann57}. One of the earliest triumphs 
of the recursion method was the sorting of the Lave 
Phases \cite{haydocklaves75,johannes76} into distinct structures. 
%Density functional studies of the crystal phases \cite{chan86,paxton97}

The ability of the tight binding framework
to provide an explanatory model for trends in homologous materials is
well demonstrated by the Pettifor's work on the transition
metal series \cite{pettifor70}, the Chevrel compounds of Molybdenum 
chalcogenides Ref.~\cite{bullet77}.
and the structures of the compounds in the Lave phases 
in Ref.~\cite{johannes76},

\section{Harmonic Approximations to the Free Energy and Entropy}
The crystal structure that is formed at a given temperature is that which
minimizes the Gibbs Free Energy of the system. Most electronic structure calculations
however are done at 0K. A systematic and computationally manageable way of obtaining
finite temperature energies, i.e. free energies is required.

Given a density of states . It is pleasing to report that the recursion method
is ideally suited to computing integrals of exactly that form, rapidly and accurately,
using quadrature methods. Given we now know how to compute electronic and 
vibrational density of states we are in the position to obtain, at no relative additional 
computational cost, vibrational entropies and Free Energies.

The work of Ref.~\cite{wheeler68} combined quadrature approaches
with the calculated moments of vibrational spectra to compute
thermodynamic quantites. For a comprehensive review
of entropic effects in metals and alloys see Ref.~\cite{fultz10}. 
These sources easily equip us with the expressions required. These expressions provide a starting
point for the inclusion of higher order terms in the vibrational spectra
the so called anharmonic effects which can become important at high temperatures.

\section{Stress, Strain, and Elasticity}
Shearing, straining, Young's modulus, poisson ratio, elastic tensors these are the
stuff of every undergraduate materials mechanics course.
Imagine you have some tensor $\epsilon$ and you apply a virtual pure strain to a collection atoms.

\subsection{Local Stress Fields}
The TBB Model \cite{nielsen83, sutton88} gives us a means of defining and calculating 
a local in the sense of a per atom stress tensor. If $I$ and $J$ 
are cartesian components $x,y,z$ to first order in the energy:
%
\begin{equation}
\delta E^(1) = \sum_{I} \sum_{(ij)}\Omega^{i}\sigma^{i}_{IJ}\epsilon_{IJ}
\end{equation}
%
The contribution to the IJ component of the stress tensor is:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:atomstress}
\sigma^{i}_{IJ} = \frac{1}{\Omega^{i}}\sum_{j\neq i}\sum_{\alpha\beta}G(\epsilon)_{i\alpha j\beta}\frac{\partial H_{j\beta i\alpha}}{\partial R_{jI}}(R_{jJ}-R_{iJ})
\end{equation}
%
The pair contributions can be added to obtain the full stress tensor. 
But if we are only interested in the electronic contributions
Eq.~\ref{eq:atomstress} is already good enough. For an application of the 
see Ref.~\cite{ohta90}

%As usual we need to know the $R$ dependence of our
%integrals, both hopping and on-site, which we went to the trouble 
%of learning in Chapter~\ref{chap:wannier}.

Ref.~\cite{terakura84} demonstrates how the recursion method
may be used to compute the elastic constants of a material.

The interaction of dislocations and defects reveals one of the most difficult problems
in theoretical materials science: the coupling of long range elastic fields
with local chemical changes. This coupling of length scales makes
reliable quantitative calculations difficult. Variations in the electronic structure
inducing strains in the metal matrix which feed back into the electronic structure. 
It appears that one requires a theory with quantum accuracy on the scale of an 
interatomic bond that simultaneously takes into account the long range elastic 
field.

%To proceed we will assume we can obtain a relaxed structure where all the atomic forces are
%in equilibrium. We then follow the derivation of Ref.~\cite{freedman09} which uses the free energy
%of the system at equilibrium to derive a tensor that describes the interaction of point defects 
%with elastic fields. A few different ways of computing this tensor are then described \cite{nazarov16}.
%The force method of computing the elastic dipole tensor lends itself 
%immediately to the expressions introduced all the way back in 
%Chapter~\ref{chap:invariance}, Eq.\ref{eq:tbforce}. \cite{paxton90}.

\section{Recursing through Defects and Dislocations}
The ability of the recursion method to quantify the local changes in interatomic bonding and
forces makes it a particularly useful tool for the study of dislocations. 

Understanding the interaction of interstitials and impurities with the motion of
dislocations through a crystal is a central goal of theoretical metallurgy with
with work on this subject beginning in the 1950s \cite{cochardt55}.

The local density of states for atoms at a screw dislocation core have been computed by \cite{paidar81,masuda81}. 
The change in the local bonding picture induced by a vacancy in Fe was examined in Ref.~\cite{masuda82,ohta87}.

\subsection{Charles Frank}
By way of introduction to the variety of dislocation structures that occur
we turn to F.C. Frank. Of Frank-Read dislocations fame.
%Frank wrote a number of interesting article BCC as a 
%close packed structure \cite{frank92}.

\section{Grain Boundaries}
The analysis of Read and Shockley in Ref.~\cite{read50} serves as a comprehensive
introduction to the field of interfaces in condensed matter. Currently the 
standard reference on the subject of interfaces in materials is Sutton and 
Baluffi Ref.~\cite{sutton95}.

A number of experimental probes are capable of detecting the presence of 
grain boundaries but efficient and accurate means of determining 
the orientation relationships between grains remains an outstanding problem.
For an analysis of the statistic arrangement of grains using quaternion
algebra see Ref.~\cite{sutton96}.

The possibility of examining grain boundaries atomistically has interested
researchers since it became practical to perform atomistic simulations
with realistic potentials see Refs.~\cite{bristowe75,wolf83,paxton87,paxton88,paxtonsutton88,
kohyama88,kohyama94,paxton96,rittner96,tschopp07,momida13,du11,du12,mceniry18} for a
snapshot of the way these studies have evolved over time.

\subsection{Discrete Boundary Dislocation Networks}
Combining isotropic elasticity with discrete dislocation networks
we can gain some useful practice in contour integration and arrive
at a closed set of expressions for the strains in a material. 

These expressions are given in Ref.~\cite{sutton95} and derived here.

\subsection{Pile Ups}
Another interesting case is discussed in Ref.~\cite{eshelby} 
where free dislocations pile up next to a pinned dislocation.

\section{Alloys}
The application of the recursion method to random lattices is described.
\cite{glaser81}
%
\begin{equation}
H_{nm} = e_{n}\delta_{nm} + V_{nm}
\end{equation}
%
Mookerjee and Haydock extended the recursion method to the case of random alloys.
The developement of the recursion method to handle random material systems is 
itself quite ingenious \cite{mookerjee, haydock74}. The Hamiltonian is extended
so that tight binding hops on a real lattice are made along with potential hops
on a "field" lattice. The field lattice can be cast in tridiagonal form to represent
the underlying statistical distribution of the random alloy. Different graphs are available
to represent rectangular random distributions, binary distributions, Gaussian distributions
etc. Fig.~\ref{fig:fieldsite.png} gives an example of the first few hops on a "field-site" 
lattice to obtain the averaged value of a Green's function. The hopping of the recursion method
is now coupling lattice sites and taking into account the underlying distribution of 
the underlying parameters.

Despite its elegance the number of paths now emanating from an initial orbital, both
for electrons to hop from orbital to orbital (lattice hops) and for the hops between 
statistical configurations (field hops) are considerable and simplifying approximations 
need to be found due to the difficulty of enumerating all the possible paths.

Early work on DOS of alloys \cite{cubiotti77}. 

\section{Metallic Surfaces}
Elegant experimentation can access some surprisingly delicate quantities \cite{whipp34}.
See \cite{bullet77} for calculations of the adsorption energy of H on W and Pt.

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter we have looked at a number of the important quantities that
arise in metallurgy and how the recursion method is ideally suited to their 
computation. The motion of dislocations, the structure of grain boundaries, 
and alloying.
