		  dependence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions which
		  is absent in the LDA. The scheme can be regarded as a
		  `first-principles' method because there are no adjustable
		  parameters. When applied to the transition metal and
		  rare-earth metal compounds, the LDA+U method gives a
		  qualitative improvement compared with the LDA not only for
		  excited-state properties such as energy gaps but also for
		  ground-state properties such as magnetic moments and
		  interatomic exchange parameters. The orbital-dependent
		  rotationally invariant LDA+U potential gives a correct
		  orbital polarization and a corresponding Jahn - Teller
		  distortion as well as polaron formation.}

  abstract	= {We present the generalization of the recursion method of
		  Haydock and co-workers to systems of many interacting
		  particles. This new method has close similarities to the
		  memory function or Mori formalism, but with some important
		  differences. Heisenberg's equation for the time evolution
		  of a microscopic operator is recursively transformed into a
		  tridiagonal matrix equation. This equation resolves the
		  operator into components corresponding to transitions of
		  different energies. The projected spectrum of transitions
		  has a continued fraction expansion given by the elements of
		  the tridiagonal matrix. We show that for an appropriate
		  choice of inner product this density of transitions obeys a
		  generalization of the black body theorem of
		  electromagnetism, in that it is exponentially insensitive
		  to distant parts of the system. This implies that the
		  projected density of transitions is computationally stable
		  and can be calculated even in macroscopic many-body
		  systems. We argue that the physical content of the density
		  of transitions is determined by the nature of its singular
		  points, such as discrete transitions, continuous spectrum,
		  band edges and van Hove singularities.}

		  is formulated in terms of Green functions. If G1 and G2 are
		  the resolvents for media 1 and 2, respectively, and Gs is
		  the re-solvent for a system consisting of 1 and 2 in
		  contact through an interface (not necessarily abrupt), then
		  Gs is fully obtained in terms of G1 and G2. By taking
		  suitable matrix elements one obtains: (i) a secular
		  determinant for the matching eigenvalues (surface states);
		  (ii) a for-mula for the wavefunction everywhere, and (iii)
		  a formula for the density of states. The case of a film is
		  studied in the same way. The formalism is illustrated with
		  a few examples. This paper deals with the physical
		  information contained in the matrix elements of Gs between
		  points which are either on the surface or else on the same
		  side, but the method yields also the matrix elements across
		  the surface, which are important for the theory of
		  dielectric responses in a system with an interface.},

  abstract	= {The maximum entropy (ME) method has been compared with the
		  square root terminator (SRT) and Gaussian quadrature (GQ)
		  methods, and some variants of them, for the calculation of
		  tight-binding bond energies based on the recursion method.
		  It is found that with a reasonable estimate of the band
		  edges, preferably too wide rather than too narrow a band,
		  There is no generally preferable method from the point of
		  view of how accurately the exact bond energies are
		  reproduced with from three to six recursion levels. The ME
		  methods are more stable if the chosen bandwidth is too
		  great, but are no better than the SRT methods for too
		  narrow a band. The ME densities of states have a simple
		  analytic form, readily integrated by standard real
		  integration packages. There are numerical difficulties in
		  integrating the SRT densities of states from the band
		  edges, but these can be overcome by contour integration,
		  which avoids the square root singularities. A disadvantage
		  of the ME methods is their extra computational cost and
		  numerical problems for higher numbers of levels (moments).
		  For calculating relative structural energies, the GO method
		  is superior to either of the others for more than five
		  recursion levels. Overall, the SRT method looks the least
		  useful of the three for applications to atomistic
		  relaxation.}

  abstract	= {The apparent suppression of plasmon satellites in
		  core-level photoemission at low electron kinetic energy is
		  studied. The process of photoemission is studied in the
		  Golden Rule formulation, and the final-state wavefunction
		  corresponding to the photoemitted electron leaving a
		  plasmon excited in the solid is found using perturbation
		  theory. It is found that interference between intrinsic and
		  extrinsic excitation suppresses the long-wavelength surface
		  and bulk plasmon excitation, but the shorter-wavelength
		  plasmons are still excited even at low electron kinetic
		  energies. However the satellites are featureless and are
		  probably lost in the background until the electron kinetic
		  energy is about 40 eV, with parameters appropriate to Al.
		  Subtracting the featureless 'background', total satellite
		  intensities of 14% for the surface plasmons and 31% for the
		  bulk plasmons are obtained, at an electron kinetic energy
		  of 100 eV.}

Maximum coverage is found to correspond to occupation of all bridge sites on the W(100) surface ( beta 1 phase). Bridge sites also provide maximum covalent binding at lower coverage but energy differences between alternative sites are small ( approximately 0.2 eV per H-atom) and ionic effects may stabilize adsorption above atoms in the beta 2 phase.}

  abstract	= {The method of recurrence relations allows one to calculate
		  time dependent correlation functions from first principles.
		  It originates from the Kubo scalar product which realizes
		  abstract Hilbert space of dynamical variables. For this
		  realized space, we show that there exists a unique
		  orthogonalization process by recurrence relation. The
		  method of recurrence relations exploits geometric
		  properties of the structure of the realized Hilbert space
		  such as the dimensionality and shape. These geometric
		  properties depend on models as well as static constraints,
		  e.g., temperature, wave vector, size. This method has been
		  applied to several physical models including the
		  homogeneous dense electron gas, the spin-1/2 XY and
		  transverse Ising models, the spin van der Waals model and
		  others. For these models, we have obtained the relaxation
		  function, response function and memory function.}

		  spectrum depends on both the topology and bondangle
		  distribution of the network. Comparison with experimental
		  data suggests that a-Ge contains slightly fewer
		  odd-membered rings than the Polk model and an average
		  bond-angle distortion of 10° or more. On the other hand
		  the shape of the TA-like peak depends more directly on the
		  topology of the network, giving a clearer distinction
		  between the results for structures containing both odd and
		  evenmembered rings and those containing even rings only.
		  Tentative comparison with experimental data for a-GaAs
		  suggests a structure containing very few oddmembered rings,
		  while the data for a-Ge indicate a significant number of
		  oddmembered rings. }

		  proposed recently by Hubbard and Dalton. The validity of
		  the approximations made is then tested by calculating the
		  band structures of face-centred cubic copper and iron from
		  first principles. The energy levels of Burdick and Wood are
		  found to be reproduced with a root-mean-square accuracy of
		  better than 0·01 ryd in both cases, with the use of only a
		  9 × 9 model Hamiltonian matrix. When a hybrid
		  nearly-free-electron tight-binding model Hamiltonian is
		  used as an empirical interpolation scheme, the expressions
		  derived here show explicitly how the parameters describing
		  both the hybridization and the tight-binding overlap
		  integrals may be expressed in terms of only two constants,
		  namely the energy ##IMG##

		  electrons behave like virtual bound states or resonances.
		  It is shown that the resulting basis functions are indeed
		  consistent with the NFE-TB picture, because the TB Bloch
		  sums are rapidly convergent over the first few nearest
		  neighbours since the oscillating tails of the resonant
		  wavefunctions have been completely taken care of by the

		  are accurate to second order in the width of the d band
		  and, therefore, contain terms that are directly equivalent

  abstract	= {The theory of excited electronic states is central to a
		  quantitative understanding of the interaction between light
		  and matter and hence to calculations of various x-ray and
		  optical spectra. Although ground state properties are well
		  described by density functional theory (DFT), that theory
		  is inappropriate for excited states, for which a fully
		  quantitative theory has yet to be developed. No one has
		  contributed more to than Lars Hedin to the quest for such a
		  theory. Here we briefly review a number of his key
		  contributions. One of the most influential is the "GW"
		  approximation for the self-energy of an excited electron.
		  Another is the "blue-electron" approximation for photon and
		  electron spectroscopies. A third, which is relevant to the
		  topics of this conference, is a many-body theory of x-ray
		  spectra based on the "quasi-boson" approximation. This
		  approach is a generalization of the GW approximation which
		  takes into account both extrinsic and intrinsic losses as
		  well as the interference between them, and simplifies the
		  treatment of losses and the core-hole interaction. What
		  makes Hedin's theories stand out is their mathematical
		  elegance and physical robustness, based on ideas conceived
		  before their full implementation was practical. With
		  today's advances in computational power, however, the
		  impact of Lars' work is becoming ever more widely
		  appreciated.}

abstract = "In recent years a set of computer codes has been developed at Argonne which permits one to determine the energies, structures, and point-defect properties of interfaces in metals and ionic crystals. To demonstrate some of the capabilities of these codes, in this article the calculated energies and structures of high-angle 〈100〉 twist grain boundaries in fcc metals and in metal oxides with NaCl structure are compared. The role of impurities and Schottky defects on the stability of such boundaries in the metal oxides is discussed in some detail. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of the interatomic potential used in our calculations on the predicted physical properties of these grain boundaries. We conclude with a summary of those properties which depend on the potential chosen (i.e. on the particular material considered) and those phenomena which are independent of the potential."

		  studied by using the concept of the Fano effect which is
		  commonly used in solid state optics. A simple theory based
		  on the Anderson model is presented to explain the asymmetry
		  in the local density of states (DOS) of s and p symmetry in
		  a d band metal. A prescription is given for calculating the
		  parameters in the Anderson model from first principles and
		  some simple example calculations are carried out to
		  illustrate AR. An antiresonance (AR) dip position in a
		  local DOS at a given site is quite insensitive to a change
		  in the potential at the site, while the d band at the
		  surrounding sites is shifted due to the potential change.
		  It is pointed out that this shift of the d band results in
		  AR in a generalised phase shift Delta N L , that is, a
		  change in the number of occupied states due to the
		  potential change. The significance of AR in Delta N L in
		  several phenomena is discussed.}

  abstract	= {The elastic constants of BCC transition metals (Fe, Nb, Mo
		  and W) are calculated by using the tight-binding d band and
		  the Born-Mayer repulsive potential. Introducing a small
		  distortion characteristic to C 44 (or C') elastic
		  deformation and calculating the energy change up to second
		  order in the atomic displacement, the authors determine the
		  shear elastic constants C 44 and C'. The elastic constants
		  C 11 and C 12 are then calculated by using the relations B=
		  1 / 3 (C 11 +2C 12 ) and C'= 1 / 2 (C 11 -C 12 ), where B
		  is the bulk modulus. In general, the agreement between the
		  present results and the experimental values is
		  satisfactory. The characteristic elasticity behaviour, i.e.
		  the strong N d (number of d electrons) dependence of the
		  observed anisotropy factor A=C 44 /C', is also discussed.}

abstract = "In high-strength carbon steels suitable for use in the automotive industry, hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is a potential barrier to the widespread application of these materials. The behaviour of hydrogen within the most prevalent carbide, namely cementite, has been investigated via ab initio simulation. In order to examine possible decohesion effects of hydrogen on carbon steels, the binding and diffusion of hydrogen at the interface between ferrite and cementite has been examined. In order to understand the effect of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of carbon steels, simulated ab initio tensile tests have been performed on the ferrite-cementite bicrystal. The results of the tensile tests can be combined with thermodynamic considerations in order to obtain the expected hydrogen concentrations at such ferrite-cementite phase boundaries. We find that the effect of hydrogen on the cohesion of the phase boundary may be significant, even when the bulk hydrogen concentration is low."

This approach is based on an atomic-sphere approximation to the KKR method and splits the band structure problem into structural and potential-dependent parts, the former being solved once and for all for a given crystal structure. The potential-dependent part involves the calculation of logarithmic derivatives at the atomic sphere appropriate to the solid under consideration, and can be parameterized in terms of quantities which have a simple physical interpretation."

abstract={The authors present the tight-binding bond (TB) model, which provides a method of calculating bond energies and interatomic forces within a quantum-mechanical framework, and they apply it to the case of a single vacancy in BCC transition metals. Vacancy-induced changes in the strength of the bonds are described: the major changes are a marked strengthening of the bonds connecting the atom (111) to (222) and a lesser strengthening of the bonds surrounding the vacancy. This shows the importance of the effect of the bond charge redistribution induced by the vacancy. Defect forces obtained are negligibly small for the first neighbours of the vacant site, and inward and very large for the second and fifth neighbours. Lattice distortion around the vacancy to relax these forces evaluated using the experimental perfect-lattice Green functions is long-range, inward and radial except for the hardly displaced first-neighbour atoms. These results are quite different from those of the usual phenomenological models which do not account for the dominant effect of the bond charge redistribution. The results converge qualitatively well by including up to fifth moments in the calculation of the bond order.}

  abstract={The heat of H absorption by beta and delta Zr hydrides has been measured by isoperibol calorimetry over the range of H concentration 0.1-1.6 H/Zr at temperatures 873-1273 K. In the beta hydride the heat per H atom (differential heat) increases and then decreases as the H concentration increases. In the delta hydride only a decrease at large H concentrations is clearly observed. The increase in the beta hydride is related by self-consistent calculations to a pair indirect interaction between H atoms; the decreases in the beta and delta hydrides are due to a pair direct interaction, which is of the form of a screened Coulomb potential. The differential heat is estimated from the pair indirect and direct interactions by the use of Monte Carlo simulations and compared with the measured differential heat.}

  abstract={The atomic structure of the (310) symmetric tilt grain boundary in Nb and of an interface between Mo and Re is calculated. The calculations are done within the tight binding (TB) approximation to quantum mechanics and are checked carefully against some accurate first-principles calculations in the local density approximation to density functional theory. A non-orthogonal spd electron TB model is tested, but is found to be no improvement on the much simpler orthogonal d-electron model; in particular there is no improvement in the volume dependence of the total energy. The structure of the Nb grain boundary is compared to that obtained by other authors using high resolution electron microscopy. The comparison enables some statements to be made about the nature of the interatomic interactions and especially about the opposing forces that are balanced at the equilibrium grain boundary expansion. The paper includes the first quantum mechanical calculation of a dissimilar metal interface with a view to obtaining the structure of a misfit dislocation and a value for the theoretical strength of the interface. It is concluded that the misfit dislocation in this case has a widely spread core and that the theoretical strength is considerably reduced relative to the bulk crystal.}

The asymptotic continued-fraction coefficients (recursion coefficients) are then related to a particular motion in the Toda lattice. As a result of this relation, the analytic expressions for the simply oscillating asymptotic recursion coefficients in the two-band (single-gap) case are given explicitly in terms of the Jacobian elliptic functions and in the Fourier series forms.}

When band gaps exist, it is known that they exhibit asymptotic undamped oscillations. In order to clarify these asymptotic behaviours, an analytic study of the recursion method applicable to the band-gap case is presented. The asymptotic properties of the system of orthogonal polynomials to which this method is closely related, are investigated by use of the concept of the exterior mapping function. Various relations, which connect the means of the recursion coefficients to the support of a spectrum, are obtained. The period of their asymptotic oscillations is written as a function of the support. The numerical results by Turchi, Ducastelle and Treglia (1982) can be well interpreted by the present theory. The asymptotic properties of the truncated basis are also examined.}

they exhibit undamped oscillations. 
The authors characterise these oscillations completely by 
studying the spectrum of periodic linear chains. It is found 
that the coefficients are periodic Abelian functions of n 
(elliptic functions in the case of a single gap), 
in agreement with recent results by Magnus (1979). The corresponding 
recurrence laws are derived, and methods for terminating the continued

and numerous examples and applications are provided.}

We discuss the implementation of the calculations of forces, stresses and magnetic torques with analytic BOPs. We show the scaling of analytic BOP calculations with the number of atoms and moments, present options for speeding up the calculations and outline different concepts of parallelisation.

effects for understanding the basic features of plastic behaviour was first recognized in the case of bcc metals. At this time the first
extensive computer modelling studies of dislocation cores were initiated. In this paper we show how the atomistic studies of dislocations
advanced since these early calculations and how the basic ideas, developed at this time, apply when analysing deformation properties of
other materials. Since a description of atomic interactions is the precursor of any atomistic calculations we first briefly describe the
present status in this area, in particular the recently developed N-body potentials. Next, we discuss the concept of generalised stacking
faults and associated energy-displacement surfaces (γ-surfaces). In this part we demonstrate how the symmetry considerations can be used to
assess the existence of possible metastable planar faults which play a role in dislocation splitting. A general discussion of planar and
non-planar dislocation cores then follows in which the dislocation splitting and core phenomena are combined into one notion. These general
concepts are illustrated by results of recent studies of the dislocation cores in hcp metals and intermetallic compounds with L12 and DO22
structures. Using these results we discuss the physical reasons for the following phenomena: preference for the prism slip in some hcp
metals, anomalous positive temperature dependence of the yield stress for prism slip in beryllium, similar anomalous yield behaviour
observed in L12 intermetallic compounds, such as Ni3Al, existence of another class of L12 compounds with a strong temperature dependence of
the yield stress at low temperatures, and brittleness of DO22 compounds."

  abstract={The second moment approximation of tight-binding theory gives an electronic band energy per atom which has the form of the square root of a pairwise sum of squared hopping integrals. This functional form for the dependence of the energy on local coordination has been the basis of empirical non-pairwise force models for transition and noble metals. Hitherto, it appeared to be valid only for a half-filled band. By introducing the assumption that the atoms keep the same charge in all environments, the authors show that the square root function is appropriate for all band fillings.}

  abstract={The authors assess the viability of nonself-consistent total energy calculations using the Harris-Foulkes energy functional. The self-consistent electron density in 11 aluminium structures is resolved into components that are qualitatively similar to the free pseudo-atomic density. For many of the structures the components display significant anisotropies, whilst between the structures there are also important differences. By studying the sensitivity of the Harris-Foulkes energy functional to perturbations in the input electron density, they are able to relate these differences in atomic-like densities to differences in energy. They conclude that no estimate for the electron density based on the superposition of spherical densities can be expected to give errors in the energy of less than 0.03 eV per atom. Given the significant variation in atomic-like electron densities from structure to structure, any transferable density scheme is also prone to energy errors. By constructing a least-squares fit of electron density data to a given functional form, they conclude that the errors in the absolute energies per atom are typically of the order of 0.05 eV whilst for energy differences they drop to 0.01 eV.}

Defect forces obtained are characteristic to each divacancy configuration. These results show the importance of the effect of the bond charge redistribution induced by the divacancies, which is not accounted for by the usual phenomenological models. Formation energies of the unrelaxed divacancies are calculated and compared for the three configurations, indicating that the first neighbour divacancy is the most stable configuration."

Based on the calculated results, the effects of the strains on the electronic structure of 3d-group transition metals with BCC structure are discussed in detail. The dependence on the tetragonal strain of the areas of several extremal orbits on the Fermi surface of paramagnetic chromium and vanadium are estimated: the results for chromium are compared with the experimental results of molybdenum and tungsten, and for vanadium a topological change in the Fermi surface due to the strain is predicted. The changes in the band energy due to the tetragonal and trigonal strains are calculated by a new method and the results are shown to agree qualitatively with the trends of the elastic constants C' and C44 in the 3d-group transition-metal alloys with BCC structure.}

This chapter presents a discussion on Euclidean fugues. This discussion includes the algorithm of Euclid, Euclidean ring, and the extended Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm of Euclid is best known as an algorithm to compute a greatest common divisor of two integers or two polynomials, but it can as well be used to compute a greatest common divisor of two elements from a general Euclidean domain. This is commonly defined as an integral domain where a certain division property holds that forms the basis of the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm tracks the signal as it penetrates in the layered medium. The extended Euclidean algorithm uses a layer peeling technique to compute the effect of the successive layers (compute Vk) and uses this information to build up the model (multiply out V0,k). However, this is not what is usually meant by a layer adjoining algorithm. In contrast to the layer peeling method, where the effect of the first layer is computed for the whole signal, the layer adjoining method will only process as much of the signal as is needed to identify the first layer."

I will try to show, however, that the two are very closely connected and that shell-model calculations may be used to give a great deal of information not normally associated with the shell-model. Professor French has demonstrated clearly to us that the level spacing fluctuations in nuclear spectra convey very little physical information. This is true when the fluctuations are averaged over the entire spectrum but not if one's interest is in the lowest few states, whose spacings are relatively large. If one wishes to calculate a ground state (say) accurately, that is with an error much smaller than the excitation energy of the first excited state, very high moments, {\textmu}n, n ≈ 200, are needed. As I shall show we use such moments as a matter of course, albeit without actually calculating them; in fact I will try to show that, if at all possible, the actual calculations of moments is to be avoided like the plague.",

            The author shows that they are in good agreement with the exact ones. 
            This method also notably improves the continued-fraction 
            expansion of the density of states. An application is made to the 
            calculation of the bulk Si and GaAs electronic densities of states.}

  abstract={The application of the recursion method of Haydock et al. (1975) to the problem of potential scattering on a lattice by an extended impurity is discussed. The approach is an alternative to the Koster-Slater method and yields bound state energies and lattice phaseshifts corresponding to the irreducible representations of the impurity point group symmetry, as well as the total density of states. The method avoids huge determinants by taking advantage of a fixed point in the recurrence relations and by using the asymptotic behaviour of the recurrence coefficients. The extrapolation of continued fraction coefficients and the construction of 'seed states' for the recursion method are discussed. Illustrative applications are made to the case of an extended impurity in a triangular lattice and to a shallow Coulomb impurity in an FCC lattice, the latter of which is compared with effective mass theory.}

It is shown that the inclusion of tight-binding interactions between second nearest neighbours in ordered binary systems produced undamped asymptotic oscillations of the recursion coefficients. A method for testing continued fractions with this sort of behaviour of the coefficients is presented and tested for the case of the binary chain of the s orbitals. The resulting local densities of states consist of two bands with different widths. The formalism is applied to intermetallic compounds with B2 (CsCl) structure. Local partial densities of states are given for bulk TiFe and CuZn. The local partial densities of states are good approximations for X-ray L spectra, although only d orbitals have been included.}

abstract = { In a recent years many binary alloys have been examined by means of X-rays and their structures have been determined at various compositions. It has been shown in this way that a pure phase consists of a single structure, whilst in the regions of mixed phases the alloy forms a simple mixture of two crystal types. Sometimes the range of composition of a pure phase is extremely narrow, as, for example, in the ε-phase of the Cu-Sn alloy. The composition within this phase corresponds almost exactly with the formula Cu3Sn. Examples of this kind have naturally led to the conception of intermolecular compounds, and, since the formation of a compound in chemistry is described in terms of valency bonds, it is natural that in the existing literature attempts to discuss the reason for the formation of various phases, and the properties of the alloys in these phases, have been based mainly upon the conception of the homopolar bond. It does not seem , however, that this conception is very successful in the interpretation of the formation and properties of metallic alloys. It is advantageous therefore at attempt an examination of alloys from the standpoint of he Bloch model. In Bloch’s theory a stationary state of an electron in a crystal is specified by the three components of a vector k which may be regarded as the average momentum associated with the state; k is not, however, the average velocity times the mass of the electron, but is defined in such a way that the rate of change of k is proportional to the external force acting on the electron. Since the difference in k between two successive stationary states is in general exceedingly small, the vector k may be regarded as varying continuously from state to state. It is now a wellknown result of the theory that the energy of a state is not a continuous function of position in k space, but is discontinuous across certain planes. The positions of these planes are determined by the crystal symmetry of the metal, and they divide k space into the various “Brillouin zones.” }

lattice into polyhedra, one polyhedron surrounding each atom. We shall 
call each polyhedrons extend throughout the whole lattice and have
certain periodicity properties, which lead to boundary conditions for the wave function 
at the surface of each unit polyhedron. For the
state of lowest energy, the wave function is obtained, in each unit polyhedron, by solving the Schr\"odinger equation $\nabla^{2}\phi_0 + 8\pi2m/h2 (W-V) \phi_0=0$ (1) with the boundary 
condition $\delta \phi_0/\delta n = 0$, (1A) where $\delta/\delta n$ denotes the normal

abstract = { A great deal of work has been done by X-ray methods on the relation between atomic volume and composition in alloy systems, but a large portion of the data so far recorded has not been determined with the high precision attainable by present methods of analysis. This paper contains the results of precision measurements on copper-zinc alloys covering the whole range of composition from one end of the equilibrium diagram to the other. Previous work in this field covers several binary systems. Vegard and his co-workers examined the alkali halides, the copper-nickel and other alloys, and found that generally the lattice dimensions change linearly with the composition. The gold-copper system did not follow this rule; this was confirmed later by van Arkel and Basart, who deduced from their observations that the fifth exponent of the atomic "diameter” was more suitable than the first as an additive quantity. Westgren and his collaborators also measured the lattice dimensions of a number of binary alloy systems. They found that a marked contraction takes place in all cases where chemically unrelated metals are alloyed with each other, the contraction being too pronounced to make the linear dimensions additive. In a paper on the silver-cadmium alloy systems, by Astrand and Westgren, the change in atomic volume with composition is traced through all the pure phases α, β, γ, and η of that system. The discontinuities between the phases are but slightly marked; this is taken to indicate that in this system the atoms occupy approximately the same space, whatever their grouping may be. Owen and Preston, in a study of the copper-zinc system, tentatively took a smooth curve through the determined atomic volumes for various compositions. They found a marked contraction in atomic volume. }
