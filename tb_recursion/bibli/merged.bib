annote = {The authors have examined the structural and electronic properties of a (001) symmetrical tilt grain boundary in Si the Sigma =5, (130) boundary, with a semi-empirical tight-binding model. Energy minimisation calculations have shown that the model of Bacmann (1985) and coworkers consisting of a zigzag arrangement of the 5-3 units is more energetically favoured than the model of Hornstra (1959) consisting of a straight arrangement of the 5-3 units. The optimum rigid-body translation of the stable configuration is consistent with the experiment on a Ge bicrystal. The calculated electronic structure has localised boundary states at the band edges and inside the valence band, which are caused by structural disorder such as the presence of odd-membered rings, the dihedral angle disorder and the bond length and bond angle disorder. However, there are no deep states inside the fundamental gap because of the absence of dangling bonds. Thus this boundary is considered to be electrically non-active intrinsically. The present results support the idea that the observed electrical activity of grain boundaries should be attributed to an intrinsic effect in the coincidence (001) tilt grain boundaries.}

    abstract = { An extremely careful inquiry is made into the possibility of predicting bond lengths in condensed aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. Agreement with the best experimental values, such as those of Robertson, Abrahams, White, Mathieson and Sinclair, is fairly easily obtained to an accuracy of about 0.02Å. This shows that the concept of fractional bond order may quite properly be used to infer bond lengths. Both the molecular-orbital and resonance methods are equally good for this purpose. Predictions to within less than 0.02Å require the introduction of new factors usually neglected. No less than five such factors are discussed: (а) electrostatic forces, arising from possible differences in electronegativity of the various carbon atoms, (b) changes of bond orders due to electronegativity differences, (c) variation of resonance integrals with bond length, (d) obtaining a self-consistent set of resonance integrals, (e) inclusion of configuration interaction. Correction terms which result from these improvements lie between 0 and 0.015Å, and are not all of the same sign. It is unlikely therefore that this type of analysis will be able to give confident predictions of bond lengths to less than 0.01Å. }

abstract = { In this paper we examine the simple theory of π-electron ring currents in conjugated systems (devised originally by London (1937) and extended by People (1958) and McWeeny (1958)), with particular reference to the topological or graph-theoretical aspects of it (all the necessary graph-theoretical ideas and terminology are explained in the text). There is a close correspondence between the adjacency matrix of the graph representing the σ-bond skeleton of the carbon atoms comprising a given conjugated system, and the secular equations which arise in the theory (a relation now well known to be common to all formalisms based on Hückel ‘topological’ molecular orbitals), but in addition we here emphasize that several other graph-theoretical ideas–notably those concerning circuits and spanning trees–specifically underlie the ring current concept. In this connexion, the question of whether any given molecular graph is semi-Hamiltonian or non-Hamiltonian is of prime importance, and it is pointed out that a unitary transformation originally proposed by McWeeny applies to semi-Hamiltonian molecular graphs, whereas one recently devised by Gayoso \&amp; Boucekkine can be applied to any simple, connected graph–as also can an explicit ring current formula (based on the London–McWeeny theory) just published by the present author. These ideas are illustrated by some simple numerical calculations, and an example is given of a conjugated system (decacyclene) whose molecular graph is apparently non-Hamiltonian. It is emphasized that although much graph theory is inherent in the ring current concept, the ring current index itself is not a completely topological quantity–even when a purely topological wavefunction  (such as the simple Hückel one) has been used to calculate it. }

    abstract = { The failure of existing theories to account for the type of crystal structure of a given metal is emphasized. It is suggested that, particularly when the number of bonding electrons is high, the metallic bond has greater directional characteristics than are generally assumed, and that these can be related to the symmetries of known hybrid bonds. Hybrids in­volving both gerade and ungerade orbitals (e. g. sp3) are not centro-symmetrical, and give rise to electron clouds biased on one side of the atom, which are thus strongly directional and suitable for strong bonding. Hybrids derived from gerade orbitals are centro-sym­metrical, so that the binding electron has an equal chance of finding itself on opposite sides of the atom. This bonding is weaker, but the number of ligands is doubled; thus the four tetrahedral directions of the sd3 hybrid can give bonding to eight neighbours, as with an atom in a body-centred cubic structure. These ideas are applied to the face-centred cubic, body-centred cubic and close-packed hexagonal structures of the transition metals, and it is shown that the hybrids suggested by the crystal structures can be correlated with the known electron characteristics of these metals. An explanation of the difference between the crystal structures of the elements of groups VIIA and VIIIA of the first and those of the later transition series is advanced, and the general tendency for transition elements to be more soluble in the body-centred cubic than in the close-packed hexagonal modification of titanium and zirconium is explained. }

The electron densities and bond orders appear as first-order derivatives of the energy of the mobile electrons with respect to the energy integrals in the secular equations; and various other relations are established which confirm the appropriateness of the definitions. A set of new quantities are introduced and discussed for the first time, namely, the mutual polarizability of two atoms or two bonds or an atom and a bond, and it is shown that they are important in determining the effect of structural changes on chemical reactivity, and also in calculating force constants and interaction terms for the vibration of bonds. Formulae are derived for the calculation of the total energy, electron densities, bond orders and mutual polarizabilities, and the relation of these quantities to other physical and chemical properties is briefly discussed. }

		  method for systems with strong Coulomb correlations is

		  insulators. The LDA+U method takes into account orbital
		  dependence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions which
		  is absent in the LDA. The scheme can be regarded as a
		  `first-principles' method because there are no adjustable
		  parameters. When applied to the transition metal and
		  rare-earth metal compounds, the LDA+U method gives a
		  qualitative improvement compared with the LDA not only for
		  excited-state properties such as energy gaps but also for
		  ground-state properties such as magnetic moments and
		  interatomic exchange parameters. The orbital-dependent
		  rotationally invariant LDA+U potential gives a correct
		  orbital polarization and a corresponding Jahn - Teller
		  distortion as well as polaron formation.}

  abstract	= {We present the generalization of the recursion method of
		  Haydock and co-workers to systems of many interacting
		  particles. This new method has close similarities to the
		  memory function or Mori formalism, but with some important
		  differences. Heisenberg's equation for the time evolution
		  of a microscopic operator is recursively transformed into a
		  tridiagonal matrix equation. This equation resolves the
		  operator into components corresponding to transitions of
		  different energies. The projected spectrum of transitions
		  has a continued fraction expansion given by the elements of
		  the tridiagonal matrix. We show that for an appropriate
		  choice of inner product this density of transitions obeys a
		  generalization of the black body theorem of
		  electromagnetism, in that it is exponentially insensitive
		  to distant parts of the system. This implies that the
		  projected density of transitions is computationally stable
		  and can be calculated even in macroscopic many-body
		  systems. We argue that the physical content of the density
		  of transitions is determined by the nature of its singular
		  points, such as discrete transitions, continuous spectrum,
		  band edges and van Hove singularities.}

The resulting ‘morphic effects’ on the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation may allow one to observe an otherwise inactive mode, and thereby reveal information about its character. We present here a general method for describing the dynamical behavior of any vibrational mode in any non-magnetic crystal structure in the presence of an electric field or stress. The simple group-theoretical approach that we follow enables us also to examine the symmetry properties of the coefficients which determine the strength and the polarization selection rules of these morphic effects."

La perovskite GdCoO3 a été étudiée entre 77 et 1200 K par mesures d'A.T.D., de diffraction X, de susceptibilité magnétique, de conductivité électrique et de pouvoir thermoélectrique. Les diverses propriétés mises en évidence, quoique différant sensiblement de celles de LaCoO3, sont en bon accord avec le modèle d'électrons localisés de Goodenough. Le cobalt passe progressivement d'un état à spin faible CoIII(t62g e0g) à un état à spin fort Co3+(t42g e2g).
GdCoO3, which has the GdFeO3 structure, has been studied between 77 and 1200 K by D.T.A., X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, electric conductivity and thermoelectric power. All properties observed, although different from those of LaCoO3, fit with the corresponding Goodenough localized electron model. With rising temperature cobalt ions pass progressively from a low-spin CoIII(t62g eg0) state to a Co3+(t42g eg2) high-spin state."

Horizontal Bridgman grown GaAs and InSb crystals were doped with phosphorus and aluminum. The segregation coefficients of these isoelectronic impurities were measured as 4 and 6 for GaAs:P and InSb:P, respectively. In GaAs:Al crystals, silicon was observed as a contaminant with [Si] roughly proportional to [Al], and hence no simple k for Al in GaAs could be given. The segregation coefficient for Al in InSb was found to be near 5."

A small, but statistically significant deviation from a linear pressure dependence was found. The first and second pressure derivatives were determined and were found to agree quite well with theoretical values which are calculated from an interatomic potential consisting of Coulomb, van der Waals and Born-Mayer type repulsive forces between first and second nearest neighbors. The isothermal equation of state is calculated from the Murnaghan approximation and compared with piezometric data of Bridgman. The Grueneisen parameter and its first pressure derivative were calculated from the elastic data in the approximation of the anisotropic elastic continuum model and agree moderately well with the corresponding thermal values."

He finds that an approximately inverse cube form for the hopping integrals as a function of interatomic separation and an approximately inverse nine-halves power for the air potential leads to an improved fit to the data including the band structure of graphite. Both the hopping integrals and the pair potential are seen to decay more rapidly than similar parameters for silicon, reflecting the absence of nuclear screening by core electron states.}^M

		  Gs is fully obtained in terms of G1 and G2. By taking

		  a few examples. This paper deals with the physical
		  information contained in the matrix elements of Gs between
		  points which are either on the surface or else on the same

		  square root terminator (SRT) and Gaussian quadrature (GQ)
		  methods, and some variants of them, for the calculation of
		  tight-binding bond energies based on the recursion method.
		  It is found that with a reasonable estimate of the band
		  edges, preferably too wide rather than too narrow a band,
		  There is no generally preferable method from the point of
		  view of how accurately the exact bond energies are
		  reproduced with from three to six recursion levels. The ME
		  methods are more stable if the chosen bandwidth is too
		  great, but are no better than the SRT methods for too
		  narrow a band. The ME densities of states have a simple
		  analytic form, readily integrated by standard real
		  integration packages. There are numerical difficulties in
		  integrating the SRT densities of states from the band
		  edges, but these can be overcome by contour integration,
		  which avoids the square root singularities. A disadvantage
		  of the ME methods is their extra computational cost and
		  numerical problems for higher numbers of levels (moments).
		  For calculating relative structural energies, the GO method
		  is superior to either of the others for more than five
		  recursion levels. Overall, the SRT method looks the least
		  useful of the three for applications to atomistic
		  relaxation.}

The CP formulation involves plane-wave expansions for wavefunctions and potentials and is best suited when the atoms can be represented by weak pseudopotentials. An alternative approach employs expansions in localized orbitals and may prove advantageous where strong potentials are encountered. The approach derives forces from a density functional closely related to the Kohn-Sham functional but defined rigorously on function space, in particular for a sum of site densities. This simplifies force calculation substantially. The site densities are represented via a density basis and the orbitals by an orbital basis of exponentially localized Lambda -functions whose exponents are optimized dynamically. The potential of the approach is demonstrated via explicit calculations, including molecular-dynamics simulations for hydrogen clusters.}

    abstract = {The `Green's function' method for the calculation of electronic band structure is investigated. The general T-matrix theory of Beeby and Edwards is used to transform the formulae of Korringa and of Kohn and Rostoker to a `reciprocal lattice representation' which is equivalent to a `nearly free electron' formalism. The matrix elements between plane waves then correspond to a `pseudo-potential', which depends mainly on the phase shifts of the atomic potentials but which is also a function of the wave vector and energy of the Bloch state being considered. For small phase shifts it tends to the scattering amplitude or `quasi-potential' of an atomic potential.
But when a phase shift passes through π/2 this pseudo-potential goes through infinity, i.e. at a virtual bound state there is a singularity in the reaction matrix (K matrix) of the atomic potential. Such a `resonance' can give rise to a narrow band, such as a d band in a transition metal. At energies below the zero of the muffin-tin potential (where the phase shifts become imaginary), the formalism is still valid, and one gets further bands from the singularities of the T matrix - the bound states - of each potential well.
The discussion is purely formal, but suggests that the Green's function method is more than a complicated scheme of calculation capable of giving good numerical results over a wide range of energies; it can be physically interpreted and used empirically in the same way as the orthogonalized plane-wave, tight-binding and other apparently more direct techniques.}^M

Maximum coverage is found to correspond to occupation of all bridge sites on the W(100) surface ( beta 1 phase). Bridge sites also provide maximum covalent binding at lower coverage but energy differences between alternative sites are small ( approximately 0.2 eV per H-atom) and ionic effects may stabilize adsorption above atoms in the beta 2 phase.}

While the method has advantages in dealing with the properties of a molecule as a whole, such as its energy states, the extension of each orbital over the molecular framework is a disadvantage when dealing with localized properties such as directed bonds. This paper deals in a general way with the equations which molecular orbitals must satisfy, allowing for the exchange of electrons between orbitals. It is then shown that when molecules have properties of symmetry the equations can be transformed so as to be satisfied by orbitals which have the property of equivalence. These can be regarded under certain conditions as directed orbitals and the conditions for these are discussed. To illustrate the method molecules of the type XY2 are considered. }

An examination is made of the fundamental equations which must be satisfied by molecular orbitals in fields of known symmetry, particularly in molecules of the type XY n. It is shown by the methods of the group theory that these equations can be transformed to others which involve sets of equivalent functions. These are associated with equivalent orbitals which have the property of being identical as regards distribution in space and differ only in their orientation. It is shown that under certain conditions these can be regarded as localized orbitals associated with particular bonds. General formulae are obtained and applied to the particular cases of molecules of trigonal, tetrahedral and octahedral symmetry. }

abstract = {The expression for the total energy of a saturated molecule is discussed. It is shown that it can be written as the sum of suitably defined bond energies. The total energy of a con­jugated molecule is not additive but can be expressed as a sum of bond energies together with a resonance energy which can be calculated by means of the standard excited state approximation. For hydrocarbon molecules, by a series of coincidences, this method leads to the same expression for the resonance energy as the Hückel method. A method of cal­culating the energies of some of the ground state-triplet transitions of conjugated molecules is also described. The energy of the phosphorescence transition is calculated for some hydrocarbon molecules and is in good agreement with experiment.}

abstract = { The properties of equivalent orbitals, as defined in previous parts, are examined in more detail. It is shown that the
character of an equivalent set can be deduced knowing the symmetry group of a single orbital of the set. This theorem has several useful applications. Further properties of equivalent sets are found by considering the structure of the molecular symmetry group in relation to the symmetry group of an orbital. An investigation whether or not equivalent orbitals in a molecule are uniquely defined shows that there are still degrees of freedom available which can be used to satisfy additional conditions. }

		  bond-angle distortion of 10° or more. On the other hand
		  the shape of the TA-like peak depends more directly on the
		  topology of the network, giving a clearer distinction
		  between the results for structures containing both odd and
		  evenmembered rings and those containing even rings only.
		  Tentative comparison with experimental data for a-GaAs
		  suggests a structure containing very few oddmembered rings,
		  while the data for a-Ge indicate a significant number of
		  oddmembered rings. }

  abstract={In the tight binding theory of transition metals, the d band arises out of the 
            interatomic matrix elements ($<phi d|v|phi>$). In the resonance theory of transition metals, 
            on the other hand, the d band is described in terms of the intra-atomic resonance
            parameters of the potential v. The equivalence of these two seemingly different points 
            of view is demonstrated by deriving general
            analytic expressions for ($<phi d |v|phi d>$) in terms of the 
            position and width of the resonance of v and the tail of the localized  
            d state phi d (r). The derivation is accomplished by expanding the d state 
            centred on one site in terms of spherical harmonics centred on
            the second site and then approximating the surviving l=2 expansion coefficient.

The formal basis for the approach is first examined to emphasise that not all band calculations are applications of the same theory. Similarly the critical points, both fundamental and mundane, of the self-consistency process are examined. Again, the central theme is the idea that perhaps some aspects of the self-consistent calculation are not completely established. On the other hand, band structure technique, while still developing, has been rather well explored. Thus one can examine it from the general point of view of seeing what the various techniques imply about the nature of the band structure problem. Finally, some applications of self-consistent band structure calculations are examined.}

  abstract	= {The first principle Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker functional and
		  basis functions are transformed directly into the hybrid
		  nearly-free-electron tight binding (H-NFE-TB) form for the
		  case of the transition metals in which the valence
		  electrons behave like virtual bound states or resonances.
		  It is shown that the resulting basis functions are indeed
		  consistent with the NFE-TB picture, because the TB Bloch
		  sums are rapidly convergent over the first few nearest
		  neighbours since the oscillating tails of the resonant
		  wavefunctions have been completely taken care of by the
		  conduction basis set. Further, the H-NFE-TB matrix elements
		  are accurate to second order in the width of the d band
		  and, therefore, contain terms that are directly equivalent
		  to the orthogonality and three-centre integrals of the
		  conventional TB scheme. Finally, the basis functions are
		  orthonormalized and the corresponding energy independent
		  model Hamiltonian presented. The accuracy of this H-NFE-TB
		  representation is illustrated by comparison with the first
		  principle wavefunctions and band structure of iron.}

		  the conduction band is accurately described by an Ashcroft

		  dependence. The d band occupancy to the left of the series
		  is very sensitive to the relative ion core volume which

These maps are important for both pedagogical and predictive purposes. A structural energy difference theorem is proved which allows the microscopic origin of the structural trends to be explored in terms of physically intuitive concepts such as atomic size, electronegativity difference, and valence. The remaining papers of this series examine theoretically the pd-, dd- and sp-sp-bonded AB compounds.}

		  quantitative understanding of the interaction between light
		  and matter and hence to calculations of various x-ray and
		  optical spectra. Although ground state properties are well
		  described by density functional theory (DFT), that theory
		  is inappropriate for excited states, for which a fully
		  quantitative theory has yet to be developed. No one has
		  contributed more to than Lars Hedin to the quest for such a
		  theory. Here we briefly review a number of his key
		  contributions. One of the most influential is the "GW"
		  approximation for the self-energy of an excited electron.
		  Another is the "blue-electron" approximation for photon and
		  electron spectroscopies. A third, which is relevant to the
		  topics of this conference, is a many-body theory of x-ray
		  spectra based on the "quasi-boson" approximation. This
		  approach is a generalization of the GW approximation which
		  takes into account both extrinsic and intrinsic losses as
		  well as the interference between them, and simplifies the
		  treatment of losses and the core-hole interaction. What
		  makes Hedin's theories stand out is their mathematical
		  elegance and physical robustness, based on ideas conceived
		  before their full implementation was practical. With
		  today's advances in computational power, however, the
		  impact of Lars' work is becoming ever more widely
		  appreciated.}

abstract = "In recent years a set of computer codes has been developed at Argonne which permits one to determine the energies, structures, and point-defect properties of interfaces in metals and ionic crystals. To demonstrate some of the capabilities of these codes, in this article the calculated energies and structures of high-angle 〈100〉 twist grain boundaries in fcc metals and in metal oxides with NaCl structure are compared. The role of impurities and Schottky defects on the stability of such boundaries in the metal oxides is discussed in some detail. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of the interatomic potential used in our calculations on the predicted physical properties of these grain boundaries. We conclude with a summary of those properties which depend on the potential chosen (i.e. on the particular material considered) and those phenomena which are independent of the potential."

We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special ‘preconditioning’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable."

    abstract = {Non-self-consistent calculations of total energies using the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham functional and the approximate functional of Harris have been made for a three-layer (111) slab of aluminium and compared to fully self-consistent calculations. The norm-conserving pseudopotential of Bachelet, Hamann and Schluter was used. The Harris total energy for the slab, which is calculated from an input charge density constructed by superimposing free atomic charge densities, is closer to the self-consistent energy for reasons which are discussed in detail. Nevertheless, the corresponding Harris surface energies are not sufficiently accurate to be useful. By renormalising the atomic charge densities which are superimposed to form the input charge density, in particular by pushing charge from the tails towards the cores, the surface energy from a self-consistent calculation can be accurately reproduced by the Harris functional. Furthermore the Harris functional with the same renormalised atoms accurately reproduces the surface-layer contraction and also the formation energy of a vacancy (to within 0.01 eV) obtained from self-consistent calculations.}

		  illustrate AR. An antiresonance (AR) dip position in a

		  in the potential at the site, while the d band at the
		  surrounding sites is shifted due to the potential change.
		  It is pointed out that this shift of the d band results in

		  change in the number of occupied states due to the

The behaviour of hydrogen within the most prevalent carbide, namely cementite, has been investigated via ab initio simulation. In order to examine possible decohesion effects of hydrogen on carbon steels, the binding and diffusion of hydrogen at the interface between ferrite and cementite has been examined. In order to understand the effect of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of carbon steels, simulated ab initio tensile tests have been performed on the ferrite-cementite bicrystal. The results of the tensile tests can be combined with thermodynamic considerations in order to obtain the expected hydrogen concentrations at such ferrite-cementite phase boundaries. We find that the effect of hydrogen on the cohesion of the phase boundary may be significant, even when the bulk hydrogen concentration is low."

Techniques which allow this strategy to be implemented efficiently and reliably, including a self-regulatory mechanism for choosing the random step distribution, are described. The method is applied to a set of standard global minimization problems, and to a typical non-linear least-squares functional fitting problem."

This approach is based on an atomic-sphere approximation to the KKR method and splits the band structure problem into structural and potential-dependent parts, the former being solved once and for all for a given crystal structure. The potential-dependent part involves the calculation of logarithmic derivatives at the atomic sphere appropriate to the solid under consideration, and can be parameterized in terms of quantities which have a simple physical interpretation."

abstract={The authors present the tight-binding bond (TB) model, which provides a method of calculating bond energies and interatomic forces within a quantum-mechanical framework, and they apply it to the case of a single vacancy in BCC transition metals. Vacancy-induced changes in the strength of the bonds are described: the major changes are a marked strengthening of the bonds connecting the atom (111) to (222) and a lesser strengthening of the bonds surrounding the vacancy. This shows the importance of the effect of the bond charge redistribution induced by the vacancy. Defect forces obtained are negligibly small for the first neighbours of the vacant site, and inward and very large for the second and fifth neighbours. Lattice distortion around the vacancy to relax these forces evaluated using the experimental perfect-lattice Green functions is long-range, inward and radial except for the hardly displaced first-neighbour atoms. These results are quite different from those of the usual phenomenological models which do not account for the dominant effect of the bond charge redistribution. The results converge qualitatively well by including up to fifth moments in the calculation of the bond order.}

  abstract={The heat of H absorption by beta and delta Zr hydrides has been measured by isoperibol calorimetry over the range of H concentration 0.1-1.6 H/Zr at temperatures 873-1273 K. In the beta hydride the heat per H atom (differential heat) increases and then decreases as the H concentration increases. In the delta hydride only a decrease at large H concentrations is clearly observed. The increase in the beta hydride is related by self-consistent calculations to a pair indirect interaction between H atoms; the decreases in the beta and delta hydrides are due to a pair direct interaction, which is of the form of a screened Coulomb potential. The differential heat is estimated from the pair indirect and direct interactions by the use of Monte Carlo simulations and compared with the measured differential heat.}

  abstract={The atomic structure of the (310) symmetric tilt grain boundary in Nb and of an interface between Mo and Re is calculated. The calculations are done within the tight binding (TB) approximation to quantum mechanics and are checked carefully against some accurate first-principles calculations in the local density approximation to density functional theory. A non-orthogonal spd electron TB model is tested, but is found to be no improvement on the much simpler orthogonal d-electron model; in particular there is no improvement in the volume dependence of the total energy. The structure of the Nb grain boundary is compared to that obtained by other authors using high resolution electron microscopy. The comparison enables some statements to be made about the nature of the interatomic interactions and especially about the opposing forces that are balanced at the equilibrium grain boundary expansion. The paper includes the first quantum mechanical calculation of a dissimilar metal interface with a view to obtaining the structure of a misfit dislocation and a value for the theoretical strength of the interface. It is concluded that the misfit dislocation in this case has a widely spread core and that the theoretical strength is considerably reduced relative to the bulk crystal.}

The asymptotic continued-fraction coefficients (recursion coefficients) are then related to a particular motion in the Toda lattice. As a result of this relation, the analytic expressions for the simply oscillating asymptotic recursion coefficients in the two-band (single-gap) case are given explicitly in terms of the Jacobian elliptic functions and in the Fourier series forms.}

  abstract={The recursion method gives a good approximation of the density of states in the single-band case, where the recursion coefficients converge. When band gaps exist, it is known that they exhibit asymptotic undamped oscillations. In order to clarify these asymptotic behaviours, an analytic study of the recursion method applicable to the band-gap case is presented. The asymptotic properties of the system of orthogonal polynomials to which this method is closely related, are investigated by use of the concept of the exterior mapping function. Various relations, which connect the means of the recursion coefficients to the support of a spectrum, are obtained. The period of their asymptotic oscillations is written as a function of the support. The numerical results by Turchi, Ducastelle and Treglia (1982) can be well interpreted by the present theory. The asymptotic properties of the truncated basis are also examined.}

When the support of these densities is connected (i.e.

they exhibit undamped oscillations. 
The authors characterise these oscillations completely by 
studying the spectrum of periodic linear chains. It is found 
that the coefficients are periodic Abelian functions of n 
(elliptic functions in the case of a single gap), 
in agreement with recent results by Magnus (1979). The corresponding 
recurrence laws are derived, and methods for terminating the continued 
fraction are given. The case of a single gap is treated in detail, 
and numerous examples and applications are provided.}

We discuss the implementation of the calculations of forces, stresses and magnetic torques with analytic BOPs. We show the scaling of analytic BOP calculations with the number of atoms and moments, present options for speeding up the calculations and outline different concepts of parallelisation. In the appendix we compile the implemented equations of the analytic BOP methodology and comments on the implementation.

abstract = "Whilst the dislocation core structure was investigated in the early days of the dislocation theory, the importance of core
effects for understanding the basic features of plastic behaviour was first recognized in the case of bcc metals. At this time the first
extensive computer modelling studies of dislocation cores were initiated. In this paper we show how the atomistic studies of dislocations
advanced since these early calculations and how the basic ideas, developed at this time, apply when analysing deformation properties of
other materials. Since a description of atomic interactions is the precursor of any atomistic calculations we first briefly describe the
present status in this area, in particular the recently developed N-body potentials. Next, we discuss the concept of generalised stacking
faults and associated energy-displacement surfaces (γ-surfaces). In this part we demonstrate how the symmetry considerations can be used to
assess the existence of possible metastable planar faults which play a role in dislocation splitting. A general discussion of planar and
non-planar dislocation cores then follows in which the dislocation splitting and core phenomena are combined into one notion. These general
concepts are illustrated by results of recent studies of the dislocation cores in hcp metals and intermetallic compounds with L12 and DO22
structures. Using these results we discuss the physical reasons for the following phenomena: preference for the prism slip in some hcp
metals, anomalous positive temperature dependence of the yield stress for prism slip in beryllium, similar anomalous yield behaviour
observed in L12 intermetallic compounds, such as Ni3Al, existence of another class of L12 compounds with a strong temperature dependence of
the yield stress at low temperatures, and brittleness of DO22 compounds."

This functional form for the dependence of the energy on local coordination has been the basis of empirical non-pairwise force models for transition and noble metals. Hitherto, it appeared to be valid only for a half-filled band. By introducing the assumption that the atoms keep the same charge in all environments, the authors show that the square root function is appropriate for all band fillings.}

  abstract={The authors assess the viability of nonself-consistent total energy calculations using the Harris-Foulkes energy functional. The self-consistent electron density in 11 aluminium structures is resolved into components that are qualitatively similar to the free pseudo-atomic density. For many of the structures the components display significant anisotropies, whilst between the structures there are also important differences. By studying the sensitivity of the Harris-Foulkes energy functional to perturbations in the input electron density, they are able to relate these differences in atomic-like densities to differences in energy. They conclude that no estimate for the electron density based on the superposition of spherical densities can be expected to give errors in the energy of less than 0.03 eV per atom. Given the significant variation in atomic-like electron densities from structure to structure, any transferable density scheme is also prone to energy errors. By constructing a least-squares fit of electron density data to a given functional form, they conclude that the errors in the absolute energies per atom are typically of the order of 0.05 eV whilst for energy differences they drop to 0.01 eV.}

Induced changes in the strengths of metal-metal bonds due to the divacancies are described: the major changes are a marked strengthening of the bonds connecting nearest neighbour atoms of the vacant site of its fifth neighbours along the diagonal directions and a lesser strengthening of the bonds in the vicinity of the two vacant sites. Defect forces obtained are characteristic to each divacancy configuration. These results show the importance of the effect of the bond charge redistribution induced by the divacancies, which is not accounted for by the usual phenomenological models. Formation energies of the unrelaxed divacancies are calculated and compared for the three configurations, indicating that the first neighbour divacancy is the most stable configuration."

Based on the calculated results, the effects of the strains on the electronic structure of 3d-group transition metals with BCC structure are discussed in detail. The dependence on the tetragonal strain of the areas of several extremal orbits on the Fermi surface of paramagnetic chromium and vanadium are estimated: the results for chromium are compared with the experimental results of molybdenum and tungsten, and for vanadium a topological change in the Fermi surface due to the strain is predicted. The changes in the band energy due to the tetragonal and trigonal strains are calculated by a new method and the results are shown to agree qualitatively with the trends of the elastic constants C' and C44 in the 3d-group transition-metal alloys with BCC structure.}

abstract = "Publisher Summary
This chapter presents a discussion on Euclidean fugues. This discussion includes the algorithm of Euclid, Euclidean ring, and the extended Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm of Euclid is best known as an algorithm to compute a greatest common divisor of two integers or two polynomials, but it can as well be used to compute a greatest common divisor of two elements from a general Euclidean domain. This is commonly defined as an integral domain where a certain division property holds that forms the basis of the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm tracks the signal as it penetrates in the layered medium. The extended Euclidean algorithm uses a layer peeling technique to compute the effect of the successive layers (compute Vk) and uses this information to build up the model (multiply out V0,k). However, this is not what is usually meant by a layer adjoining algorithm. In contrast to the layer peeling method, where the effect of the first layer is computed for the whole signal, the layer adjoining method will only process as much of the signal as is needed to identify the first layer."

abstract="In contrast to many of the speakers at this conference I am less interested in average properties of nuclei than in detailed spectroscopy. I will try to show, however, that the two are very closely connected and that shell-model calculations may be used to give a great deal of information not normally associated with the shell-model. Professor French has demonstrated clearly to us that the level spacing fluctuations in nuclear spectra convey very little physical information. This is true when the fluctuations are averaged over the entire spectrum but not if one's interest is in the lowest few states, whose spacings are relatively large. If one wishes to calculate a ground state (say) accurately, that is with an error much smaller than the excitation energy of the first excited state, very high moments, {\textmu}n, n ≈ 200, are needed. As I shall show we use such moments as a matter of course, albeit without actually calculating them; in fact I will try to show that, if at all possible, the actual calculations of moments is to be avoided like the plague.",

  abstract={A technique is presented to extrapolate the recursion coefficients 
            from a knowledge of the first few. In the linear prediction theory, 
            the coefficients of the continued fraction are written as sums of 
            complex exponentials. The exponential decays and amplitudes 
            are obtained by a least-squares fit to the first known coefficients. 
            This procedure allows the determination of the band limits 
            which are generally not known in the recursion method. 
            The author shows that they are in good agreement with the exact ones. 
            This method also notably improves the continued-fraction 
            expansion of the density of states. An application is made to the 
            calculation of the bulk Si and GaAs electronic densities of states.}

The approach is an alternative to the Koster-Slater method and yields bound state energies and lattice phaseshifts corresponding to the irreducible representations of the impurity point group symmetry, as well as the total density of states. The method avoids huge determinants by taking advantage of a fixed point in the recurrence relations and by using the asymptotic behaviour of the recurrence coefficients. The extrapolation of continued fraction coefficients and the construction of 'seed states' for the recursion method are discussed. Illustrative applications are made to the case of an extended impurity in a triangular lattice and to a shallow Coulomb impurity in an FCC lattice, the latter of which is compared with effective mass theory.}

It is shown that the inclusion of tight-binding interactions between second nearest neighbours in ordered binary systems produced undamped asymptotic oscillations of the recursion coefficients. A method for testing continued fractions with this sort of behaviour of the coefficients is presented and tested for the case of the binary chain of the s orbitals. The resulting local densities of states consist of two bands with different widths. The formalism is applied to intermetallic compounds with B2 (CsCl) structure. Local partial densities of states are given for bulk TiFe and CuZn. The local partial densities of states are good approximations for X-ray L spectra, although only d orbitals have been included.}

barriers in the potential energy as a function of the coordinate which describes
the reaction. Adsorption of the reactants on a metal reduces the barrier by broadening
the molecular and atomic levels into resonances whose occupation depends on their
energy relative to the Fermi level. This mechanism does not depend on any approximation
or simplified model; however in order to explain the effect more clearly and to enable
estimates to be made, a variation of the Holstein model (1959) is introduced and applied
to H_2 +H as an example. It is argued that this effect applies to heterogeneous catalysis
in that covalent bonds are brought into contact with a metal, and in the opposite
extreme to embrittlement when metallic bonds are made more covalent. The general
question of mobility of bonds is related to a transition from a metal to a covalent insulator.}

abstract = {In a recent years many binary alloys have been examined by means of X-rays and their structures have been determined at various compositions. It has been shown in this way that a pure phase consists of a single structure, whilst in the regions of mixed phases the alloy forms a simple mixture of two crystal types. Sometimes the range of composition of a pure phase is extremely narrow, as, for example, in the ε-phase of the Cu-Sn alloy. The composition within this phase corresponds almost exactly with the formula Cu3Sn. Examples of this kind have naturally led to the conception of intermolecular compounds, and, since the formation of a compound in chemistry is described in terms of valency bonds, it is natural that in the existing literature attempts to discuss the reason for the formation of various phases, and the properties of the alloys in these phases, have been based mainly upon the conception of the homopolar bond. It does not seem , however, that this conception is very successful in the interpretation of the formation and properties of metallic alloys. It is advantageous therefore at attempt an examination of alloys from the standpoint of he Bloch model. In Bloch’s theory a stationary state of an electron in a crystal is specified by the three components of a vector k which may be regarded as the average momentum associated with the state; k is not, however, the average velocity times the mass of the electron, but is defined in such a way that the rate of change of k is proportional to the external force acting on the electron. Since the difference in k between two successive stationary states is in general exceedingly small, the vector k may be regarded as varying continuously from state to state. It is now a wellknown result of the theory that the energy of a state is not a continuous function of position in k space, but is discontinuous across certain planes. The positions of these planes are determined by the crystal symmetry of the metal, and they divide k space into the various “Brillouin zones.” }

abstract = { The calculations of Wigner and Seitz have shown that the Bloch theory is capable of yielding, at any rate roughly, the lattice energy, lattice constant, and compressibility of the metal sodium, and it seems probable that their method could be applied with equal success to the other alkalis. On the other hand, no calculations have as yet been made for the noble metals. Such a calculations is given in this paper. The noble metals differ from the alkalis in having cores which are much larger compared with the atomic volume than those of the alkalis, and the main purpose of this paper is to see whether direct interaction between the pressibility, etc. We have also attempted to find out why the noble metals have the face-centred cubic structure, while the alkalis are body-centred. In 2 we calculate the wave functions and energies of the valence electrons (4s) of metallic copper. We chose copper for this calculation, because a self-consistent field due to Hartree is available. Wigner and Seitz did not use the self-consistent field for sodium, but a half empirical potential function for the sodium ion, calculated by Prokofjew from the observed term values. This potential therefore includes implicitly the exchange interaction between the valence electrons and the inner shells, so far as this may be represented by an electrostatic potential. With the self-consistent field the exchange has to be taken into account explicitly; we have done this by solving approximately, instead of the simple Schroedinger equation, Fock’s wave equation, which includes the exchange. Apart from this the calculation in 2 is entirely analogous to that of Wigner and Seitz. It will be shown that for copper this calculations given at least the right order of magnitude for the lattice constant and for the heat of vaporization, but a totally incorrect value for the compressibility. }

certain periodicity properties, which lead to boundary conditions for the wave function

condition $\delta \phi_0/\delta n = 0$, (1A) where $\delta/\delta n$ denotes the normal

abstract = { A great deal of work has been done by X-ray methods on the relation between atomic volume and composition in alloy systems, but a large portion of the data so far recorded has not been determined with the high precision attainable by present methods of analysis. This paper contains the results of precision measurements on copper-zinc alloys covering the whole range of composition from one end of the equilibrium diagram to the other. Previous work in this field covers several binary systems. Vegard and his co-workers examined the alkali halides, the copper-nickel and other alloys, and found that generally the lattice dimensions change linearly with the composition. The gold-copper system did not follow this rule; this was confirmed later by van Arkel and Basart, who deduced from their observations that the fifth exponent of the atomic "diameter” was more suitable than the first as an additive quantity. Westgren and his collaborators also measured the lattice dimensions of a number of binary alloy systems. They found that a marked contraction takes place in all cases where chemically unrelated metals are alloyed with each other, the contraction being too pronounced to make the linear dimensions additive. In a paper on the silver-cadmium alloy systems, by Astrand and Westgren, the change in atomic volume with composition is traced through all the pure phases α, β, γ, and η of that system. The discontinuities between the phases are but slightly marked; this is taken to indicate that in this system the atoms occupy approximately the same space, whatever their grouping may be. Owen and Preston, in a study of the copper-zinc system, tentatively took a smooth curve through the determined atomic volumes for various compositions. They found a marked contraction in atomic volume. }

to an ionic crystal, the insulation breaks down. If the temperature is above a certain 
critical value T0 (usually of the order 100° C.), F decreases very rapidly with temperature, 
and the breakdown takes place some seconds after the application of the field. 
Wagner (cf. Semenoff and Walther 1928) has shown that in this case the breakdown is 
due to the Joule heat generated by ionic conduction, which causes local melting. 
For temperatures less than T0, on the other hand, the breakdown takes place in a 
time of the order 10-8 sec. (Rogowsky 1928) and the variation of F with temperature 
is very much smaller than in the case of heat breakdown, The phenomenon in 
this case is referred to as electrical breakdown, any melting of the crystal being 
ruled out by the short times involved. }

abstract = { It is known that in aromatic molecules the individual links have a length which is neither that of a pure single bond, nor of a pure double bond, but which is, in general, intermediate between the two. In earlier papers of this series (Lennard-Jones 1937; Penney 1937) two methods have been outlined for calculating these lengths and the energies associated with them. An approximate description of a particular link can be given if we assign to it an order. This order will be the sum of two parts, the one from the σ-bonds which is assumed to have the value unity in all cases, and the other from the π-bonds. We may call this latter contribution the “mobile order” p, since it arises from the motion of those electrons which Lennard-Jones (1937) calls “mobile electrons”. For a pure single bond such as ethane, the total order is 1; for a pure double bond such as ethylene, the total order is 2; for a pure triple bond such as acetylene, the total order is 3. The corresponding values of p are 0, 1 and 2 respectively. For other links, as for example in benzene, p will have a fractional value. }

natural consequence of the analysis, which also yields the expressions for the stresses, atomic displacements and energies associated
with the boundary, as functions of the angle of tilt, etc. By allowing the distance between dislocations to tend to infinity, these
expressions reduce to the corresponding ones for single dislocations. The outstanding feature of the interfacial energy is that it
increases initially very rapidly with the angle of tilt, etc. An application of the results to the theory of

abstract = "Publisher Summary
The chapter presents a discussion on the continuum theory of lattice defects. The continuum analog of a crystal containing imperfections is an elastic body in a state of stress not produced by surface and body forces. The appropriate tool for handling the “continuum theory of lattice defects” is thus the usual theory of elasticity modified to include internal stress. Unlike the residual stresses encountered in engineering practice, these internal stresses have to be considered as capable of moving about in the medium. Recent interest in solid state physics has stimulated further development. The discussion of this chapter emphasizes on some of the background principles and illustrates them by specific examples chosen to bring out the peculiar features involved. Naturally, the continuum theory can hardly be expected to answer questions of current interest about the more intimate behavior of lattice defects (for example, the binding energy of two adjacent point defects). On the other hand, the theory perhaps suffers from the disadvantage that its limitations are more immediately obvious than are those of other approximate methods that have to be used in dealing with the solid state, for it sometimes gives good results even in what appear to be extreme cases. The theory of elasticity is concerned with the relation between the deformation of a body and the energy content of itself and its surroundings. The chapter also discusses specification of internal stress, including the Somigliana dislocations and the incompatibility tensor."

in concentrations up to approximately 15 at.% resulted in an increase in flow stress by more than a factor two. The loss in ductility
increased with increasing hydrogen content and was accompanied by an increasing frequency of “brittle” secondary cracks. The 304 alloy was
embrittled at lower concentrations than was the 310S. In the polycrystalline austenitic stainless steels ``brittle"
cracking was predominantly intergranular, although there was evidence of shear crack formation along operating slip planes.
Intensely localized shear along active slip planes was found on both fracture surface and on polished side surfaces on
specimens containing solute hydrogen. Shear localization in the hydrogen-austenitic stainless steel solid solutions
appeared to result from the limitation of the number of active slip systems by increasing the local stress
to operate dislocation sources. In this study there was no evidence that hydrogen lowered the strength of
internal interfaces, rather fracture was found to result from an extreme localization of slip into narrow slip
bands and increased difficulty in slip transfer across interfaces.

There is a review of the current knowledge of hydrogen-metal relationships in which it is shown that the behaviour of any element, with respect to hydrogen, depends upon its position in the periodic table. The current theories of the nature of brittle fracture, and of the ductile-to-brittle transition in metals are then reviewed in terms of the origin and propagation of brittle fractures on the application of an external stress. These reviews are then followed by a detailed critical analysis of the characteristics and mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement in the body-centered-cubic metals (including steel), titanium and its alloys, alphazirconium and alpha-uranium. In each case these effects are discussed in terms of the present knowledge of the appropriate metal-hydrogen system and the theory of brittle fracture in metals. The conclusions from each of these individual reviews are then combined in the proposal of a general theory of the hydrogen embrittlement of metals which not only incorporates the essential features of each case of hydrogen embrittlement, but also suggests an explanation for the absence of similar effects in other metals."

The effective frequency in the Arrhenius expression governing these processes is shown to be, in harmonic approximation, the ratio of the product of the N normal frequencies of the entire crystal at the starting point of a transition to the product of the N−1 normal frequencies of the crystal when it is constrained in a saddle point configuration. The influence of the masses of the various atoms on the effective frequency is investigated. It is shown that an effective mass which depends on the direction of the path through the saddle point in configuration space determines this frequency. In the case of chemical diffusion by the vacancy mechanism the effective mass is approximately the same as the mass of the solute atom, and must always lie between the mass of the solute and the mass of the solvent. It is finally shown that the classical rate theory, even with many-body considerations, is unable to explain the recent observations of Lazarus and Okkerse on the isotope effect in the diffusion of iron in silver."

abstract = { The equations derived in part I of this series for a one-dimensional dislocation model are applied in this paper to the case of a monolayer on the surface of a crystalline substrate, particularly when the natural lattice spacing of the monolayer differs from that of the substrate. Justification is given for this extension of the equations to the two-dimensional case. It is shown that the theory predicts a certain critical amount of misfit (9\% difference in lattice spacing in a simple case) below which the monolayer in its lowest energy state is deformed into exact fit with the substrate, and above which it is only slightly deformed in the mean, having many dislocations between it and the substrate. The energy of adsorption as a function of misfit is also calculated, becoming almost constant above the critical limit. Up to a larger critical misfit (about 14\% in the same simple case) the monolayer can be deposited metastably in exact fit on the substrate, at sufficiently low temperature. Since the dislocated layer is mobile on the surface, completely oriented overgrowth of one crystal on another can only be expected if the first monolayer can be formed over the complete surface under subcritical conditions. This is in general agreement with observation. }

He wrote to Taylor, pointing out that his model was two-dimensional, and asking 
if a dislocation had to be a straight line. This letter was not answered, and Frank did not 
think further about dislocations until he came to Bristol at Mott’s invitation after the war, 
when he read the paper by J. M. Burgers early in 1947 and realized that the question was answered, 
and that one should think in three dimensions instead of two. Mott asked him to give a series 
of seminars on nucleation and crystal growth, and he then realized that the predicted rate of 
growth was 101000 times too small, and - the key point - that if a screw dislocation emerged 
from a crystal face, nucleation was unnecessary. The ‘spiral’ theory of Burton, Cabrera \&amp; 
Frank followed. There was a summer school in Bristol at which Frank explained the theory, and 
Griffin, from Tolansky’s laboratory, in the audience, produced photographs showing 
not only spirals, but other more complex features predicted by the theory (see Griffin 1951).}

It is shown moreover that the formation of vacancies by moving dislocations plays an essential role in these processes. Some speculations on the stability of deformation bands are given. It is suggested that the movement of vacancies (self-diffusion) plays an essential part in polygonization, recovery and steady-state creep, enabling dislocations in deformation bands to move out of their slip planes and so relieve stress. It is probable moreover that in these bands the stresses are several hundred times greater than the applied stress, and that this enables diffusion to occur at temperatures at which it would not be possible otherwise. Finally an account is given of low temperature creep of the type which does not involve recovery.}

abstract = { This paper extends the work described in a previous paper by 
one of the authors (Altmann 1957). The spherical harmonics that belong to the 
irreducible representations of the cubic groups are now given up to and 
including l = 12. Also, for all point groups the expansions in 
spherical harmonics that are given belong to the separate 
columns of the irreducible representations (whereas before they were linear 
combinations of such functions). Accordingly, full tables for the irreducible 
representations for all crystallographic point groups 
are required and are given in the paper. Finally, a technique is described, and 
used throughout in the tables, to orthogonalize several expansions that 
belong to the same column of the same irreducible representation. 
Therefore, the different expansions listed in the tables are always fully orthogonal. }

abstract = "The literature on vibrational thermodynamics of materials is reviewed. The emphasis is on metals and alloys, especially on the progress over the last decade in understanding differences in the vibrational entropy of different alloy phases and phase transformations. Some results on carbides, nitrides, oxides, hydrides and lithium-storage materials are also covered. Principles of harmonic phonons in alloys are organized into thermodynamic models for unmixing and ordering transformations on an Ising lattice, and extended for non-harmonic potentials. Owing to the high accuracy required for the phonon frequencies, quantitative predictions of vibrational entropy with analytical models prove elusive. Accurate tools for such calculations or measurements were challenging for many years, but are more accessible today. Ab initio methods for calculating phonons in solids are summarized. The experimental techniques of calorimetry, inelastic neutron scattering, and inelastic X-ray scattering are explained with enough detail to show the issues of using these methods for investigations of vibrational thermodynamics. The explanations extend to methods of data analysis that affect the accuracy of thermodynamic information. It is sometimes possible to identify the structural and chemical origins of the differences in vibrational entropy of materials, and the number of these assessments is growing. There has been considerable progress in our understanding of the vibrational entropy of mixing in solid solutions, compound formation from pure elements, chemical unmixing of alloys, order–disorder transformations, and martensitic transformations. Systematic trends are available for some of these phase transformations, although more examples are needed, and many results are less reliable at high temperatures. Nanostructures in materials can alter sufficiently the vibrational dynamics to affect thermodynamic stability. Internal stresses in polycrystals of anisotropic materials also contribute to the heat capacity. Lanthanides and actinides show a complex interplay of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic entropy, even at low temperatures. A “quasiharmonic model” is often used to extend the systematics of harmonic phonons to high temperatures by accounting for the effects of thermal expansion against a bulk modulus. Non-harmonic effects beyond the quasiharmonic approximation originate from the interactions of thermally-excited phonons with other phonons, or with the interactions of phonons with electronic excitations. In the classical high temperature limit, the adiabatic electron–phonon coupling can have a surprisingly large effect in metals when temperature causes significant changes in the electron density near the Fermi level. There are useful similarities in how temperature, pressure, and composition alter the conduction electron screening and the interatomic force constants. Phonon–phonon “anharmonic” interactions arise from those non-harmonic parts of the interatomic potential that cannot be accounted for by the quasiharmonic model. Anharmonic shifts in phonon frequency with temperature can be substantial, but trends are not well understood. Anharmonic phonon damping does show systematic trends, however, at least for fcc metals. Trends of vibrational entropy are often justified with atomic properties such as atomic size, electronegativity, electron-to-atom ratio, and mass. Since vibrational entropy originates at the level of electrons in solids, such rules of thumb prove no better than similar rules devised for trends in bonding and structure, and tend to be worse. Fortunately, the required tools for accurate experimental investigations of vibrational entropy have improved dramatically over the past few years, and the required ab initio methods have become more accessible. Steady progress is expected for understanding the phenomena reviewed here, as investigations are performed with the new tools of experiment and theory, sometimes in integrated ways."

Among those compounds, H3Se is a promising candidate of the same space group with H3S. In this work, we have thoroughly studied the electronic and phonon structures of H3Se using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is demonstrated that the electronic bands of H3Se contain van Hove singularities near the Fermi energy, which play a significant role in the superconductivity of this material. Besides, an accurate tight-binding model is proposed based on the Wannier function interpolations which can capture the main features of the electronic structures of H3Se. Moreover, we have also discussed the phonon dispersions and vibration modes for a better understanding of the phonon–electron interaction in H3Se."

The recursion method for calculating both diagonal and off-diagonal elements of resolvents is described and compared with other methods. In many recursion calculations there is a dramatic loss of basis orthogonality due to rounding error. An example is described, and it is argued that orthogonality is restored in the recursion method by projection of the resolvent. This is applied to the calculation of the density of states and the quantum mechanical transmittance."

amplitudes are plotted as spatial maps in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional random systems. 
These amplitudes are obtained from local Green functions expressed in the continued fraction form 
and the Haydock-Heine-Kelly scheme (HHK) is used in numerical evaluations. Another method examines 
the convergence of the local Green function as a function of the truncation parameter n, where n is 
the number of steps down the continued fraction. The behaviour of the coefficients in the HHK continued 
fraction can be used in a Mobius transformation analysis to give information about localisation. 
The model systems studied are the random binary alloys and the Anderson Hamiltonian. Extended 
states are shown to be very likely present even in the two-dimensional Anderson model at small enough W.}

Whereas this martensitic transformation has apparently been used for over 2500 years to produce hard steels, scientists do not yet fully understand the crystallographic mechanism. In fact, until very recently alloy design has been very much an empirical process. Soon, however, theoretical physicists will be able to contribute actively to the design of structural engineering materials.}

It originates from the Kubo scalar product which realizes abstract Hilbert space of dynamical variables. For this realized space, we show that there exists a unique orthogonalization process by recurrence relation.
The method of recurrence relations exploits geometric properties of the structure of the realized Hilbert space such as the dimensionality and shape. These geometric properties depend on models as well as static constraints, e.g., temperature, wave vector, size. This method has been applied to several physical models including the homogeneous dense electron gas, the spin-1/2 XY and transverse Ising models, the spin van der Waals model and others. For these models, we have obtained the relaxation function, response function and memory function.}

The authors focus their attention on the strength anomaly in IVa-VIII intermetallic compounds with B2 structure. It has been shown experimentally that CoTi, CoZr, and CoHf display the positive temperature dependence of yield stress at intermediate temperatures while FeTi does not have their characteristics, depending on the position of the alloying elements in the periodic table. The observed strength anomaly operating at intermediate temperatures is discussed in conjunction with the relative phase stability of B2 structure with respect to Bf or B19 phase and dislocation core structures.",

Schweber’s quantization criterion in Hilbert spaces of entire analytic functions, and (iv) a discrete
quantum mechanics of Odake and Sasaki. A recurrent theme of Haydock’s recursive solution is that the
spectral properties of any self-adjoint problem can be mapped onto a corresponding sequence of
polynomials {pn(E)} in energy variable E. The polynomials {pn(E)} are orthonormal with
respect to the density of states n0(E) and energy eigenstate |E〉 is the generating function of {pn(E)}.
The generality of Haydock’s recursive solution enables one to see the different concepts
from a unified perspective and mutually benefiting from each other. Some results
obtained within the particular framework of any of (i) to (iv) may have much broader significance."

the orthonormal polynomials and their associated Weyl solutions with respect
to $\mu$. We show that the recurrence coefficients have topologically the same convergence behavior as the sequence
$(n\omega(\infty))n\in N \% 1$.
As one of the consequences, there is a homeomorphism from the so-called gaps
$Xj=1l−1([a2j,a2j+1]+∪[a2j,a2j+1]−)$ on the Riemann surface
for $y2=∏j=12l(x−aj)$ into the set of accumulation points of the sequence of
recurrence coefficients if ω1(∞),…,ωl−1(∞), 1
are linearly independent over the rational numbers Q.
Furthermore, it is shown that the convergence behavior of the sequence of
recurrence coefficients and of the sequence of zeros of the orthonormal polynomials and
Weyl solutions outside the spectrum is
topologically the same. These results are proved by proving corresponding statements
for the accumulation points of the vector of
moments of the diagonal Green’s functions."

abstract = { An operator calculus is developed applicable to problems in the electron theory of metals. 
It differs from the common operator calculus of the quantum theory in the fact that the wave function is 
defined in a finite space (the atomic polyhedron) bounded by a finite surface. 
This leads to the introduction of surface operators. The position operator x 
cannot be developed with respect to the proper functions of the Hamiltonian. Instead 
an operator ξ is introduced, which is essentially the Fourier development of 
x. Thus there are three fundamental types of operators: the differential operator 
p, the multiplication operator ξ and the surface operators. It is shown that with 
the help of these a consistent calculus can be developed. }

crystal changes in a way which depends on the nature of the force. The resulting ‘morphic effects’ 
on the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation may allow one to observe an otherwise 
inactive mode, and thereby reveal information about its character. We present here a general method 
for describing the dynamical behavior of any vibrational mode in any non-magnetic crystal structure 
in the presence of an electric field or stress. The simple group-theoretical approach that we follow 
enables us also to examine the symmetry properties of the coefficients which determine the strength 
and the polarization selection rules of these morphic effects."

La tension interfaciale entre deux grains est mesurée, en valeur relative, dans une plaquette d'aluminium, par la méthode classique des points triples. Nous étudions sa variation en fonction de l'orientation du joint par rapport aux deux cristaux qu'il sépare et obtenons les résultats suivants: Un joint entre deux grains d'orientation quelconque (joint ⪡ banal ⪢) a une tension à peu pres constante; un joint entre deux grains dont les réseaux admettent un plan de symétrie possède une tension plus faible; celle-ci diminue encore quand le joint se trouve dans le plan de symétrie et s'annule pratiquement quand les grains sont parallèles ou en macle spinelle. Dans une deuxième partie, nous proposons un nouveau mode de calcul de l'énergie superficielle et de l'énergie interfaciale. Dans ce calcul, assez approximatif, on suppose que les deux cristaux, complètement rigides, établissent des liaisons interatomiques à travers le joint. Par une hypothèse simple, on passe de l'énergie interfaciale à l'énergie libre, c'est-à-dire la tension capillaire. Les calculs ont été faits pour l'aluminium, le cuivre, le fer γ et le fer α; pour l'aluminium, les résultats sont en bon accord, en valeur relative, avec les résultats expérimentaux de la première partie.
The interfacial tension between two grains of an aluminum disk is measured in relative values by the classical method of the three way corner. We have studied the variation of the interfacial tension as a function of the orientation of the grainboundary with respect to the two neighbouring crystals and we obtained the following results: a grainboundary between two crystals of any orientation whatsoever has a nearly constant interfacial tension. A boundary between two grains whose crystal lattices have a common plane of symmetry has a lower interfacial tension, which decreases still further if the plane of the boundary is the plane of symmetry and which practically disappears when the grains are parallel or in spinelle twin orientation. In a second part we suggest a new method of calculating the interfacial energy. In this rather approximative calculation it is supposed that the two completely rigid crystals establish interatomic-relations across the grainboundary. By a simple hypothesis one goes from the interfacial energy to the free energy, that is the surface tension. Calculations were carried out for aluminum, copper, α-iron and γ-iron. The results for A1 are in good agreement with the relative values obtained in the experiments of Part I.
Zusammenfassung
Die relativen Werte der Grenzflächenspannung zwischen zwei Kristalliten in einem Aluminium-plättchen wurden nach der klassischen Methode des Dreiwinkelpunktes gemessen. Wir untersuchten die Variation der Grenzflächenspannung als Funktion der Orientierung der Korngrenze bezogen auf die beiden Nachbarkristallite und erhielten die folgenden Resultate: Eine Korngrenze zwischen zwei Kristalliten beliebiger Orientierung hat eine fast konstante Grenzflächenspannung. Eine Korngrenze zwischen zwei Kristalliten, deren Kristallgitter eine gemeinsame Symmetrie-Ebene besitzen, hat eine geringere Grenzflächenspannung. Diese verringert sich noch weiter, wenn die Korngrenze selbst die Symmetrie-Ebene ist und ist praktisch gleich null, wenn die Kristallite parallel oder Spinellzwillinge sind. Im zweiten Teil wird eine neue Rechenmethode zur Ermittlung der Oberflächen- und Grenzflächenenergie vorgeschlagen. In der—angenäherten—Berechnung wird angenommen, dass die beiden völlig starren Kristallite über die Korngrenze hinweg auf einander interatomar einwirken. Mit Hilfe einer einfachen Hypothese kam man von der Grenzflächenergie zur freien Energie d.h. zur Oberflächenspannung. Berechnungen wurden für Aluminium, Kupfer, α-Eisen und γ-Eisen durchgeführt. Die Resultate für Aluminium stimmen gut mit den—als relative Werte anfallenden—experimentellen Resultaten überein, die im Teil I beschrieben sind."

abstract = {Abstract This paper has three aims: (i) To discuss some of the mathematical connections between N-particle wave functions ψ and their single-particle densities ρ (x). (ii) To establish some of the mathematical underpinnings of “universal density functional” theory for the ground state energy as begun by Hohenberg and Kohn. We show that the HK functional is not defined for all ρ and we present several ways around this difficulty. Several less obvious problems remain, however. (iii) Since the functional mentioned above is not computable, we review examples of explicit functionals that have the virtue of yielding rigorous bounds to the energy.},
