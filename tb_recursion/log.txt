Have a nice shape to the introduction now which will hopefully shape 
the rest of the book. Adding Wannier's after DFT chapter which will mainly
be the TB-NN work. The GW chapter should now be merged or followed by 
a simple GW as recursive perturbation theory with hermitian Sigma chapter. 

Need to tidy up the superconductivity discussion
and add the integrations. The recursion sketch there will be computing
$\lambda$ and $\mu$ using recursion theory maybe for Tungsten?

Same with the metallurgy chapter I think elasticity, phonon anomalies 
or defect calculations should be plenty in the way of examples.

Then we can move on to decorating and finalizing: 

I would like a figure of Avogadro.
Some nice path hopping pictures for the recursion method.

Some Nice TB/DFT images
GW self-energy operator.

References in the text with links to CamRecLibPy examples should also be made.

Looking at installing textext package so that I can do some nice equation
typesetting in Inkscape.

https://github.com/textext/textext/wiki/Common-issues#preview-is-not-working-but-imagemagick-is-installed
https://github.com/textext/textext

However for now we are in a good position just using the render extension
in the inkscape package. Had to append the path location for latex and dvips
to the inkscape distribution but then everything worked fine.

Added some Caltech bibmerge bibfilter tools to the system path: These might be useful.
