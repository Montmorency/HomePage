Have a nice shape to the introduction now which will hopefully shape 
the rest of the book. Adding Wannier's after DFT chapter which will mainly
be the TB-NN work. The GW chapter should now be merged or followed by 
a simple GW as recursive perturbation theory with hermitian Sigma chapter. 

Need to tidy up the superconductivity discussion
and add the integrations. The recursion sketch there will be computing
$\lambda$ and $\mu$ using recursion theory maybe for Tungsten?

Same with the metallurgy chapter I think elasticity, phonon anomalies 
or defect calculations should be plenty in the way of examples.

Then we can move on to decorating and finalizing: 

I would like a figure of Avogadro.
Some nice path hopping pictures for the recursion method.

Some Nice TB/DFT images
GW self-energy operator.

References in the text with links to CamRecLibPy examples should also be made.

Looking at installing textext package so that I can do some nice equation
typesetting in Inkscape.

https://github.com/textext/textext/issues/31
https://github.com/textext/textext/wiki/Common-issues#preview-is-not-working-but-imagemagick-is-installed
https://github.com/textext/textext
https://github.com/seebk/LaTeXText

However for now we are in a good position just using the render extension
in the inkscape package. Had to append the path location for latex and dvips
to the inkscape distribution but then everything worked fine.

Added some Caltech bibmerge bibfilter tools to the system path: These might be useful.

Important improvements to the figures. Looks much more consistent in the 
presentation. Should probably pick a color scheme. Added a nice quote 
from Heisenberg which really rounds off the discussion and motivates 
the focus on the technique.

There were improvements to the overall layout and, of course, 
the text including the Avogadro picture. A few more 
changes to the orbital peeling discussion, and complete the Block 
recursion discussion and the Local Atomic Environment chapter 
will be completed. The Block recursion is really important 
for the superconductivity chapter.

Nothing added to the Harris-Foulkes section will have 
to complete that discussion tomorrow, for the different 
stationary points along different co-ordinates.

Superconductivity notes require Dan's integrations, 
as well as the Metallurgy section for the strain fields of 
dislocations. 

Before starting on the final chapter though
there is the Python/Julia-fication of the CamRecLib 
so we can do the defects, orbital peeling of hydrogen and 
elasticity calculations all as examples.

So I can't see this being completed before the new year. Things
will be going well if it is!

Hope to do some work on the block recursion this evening. Lewis and Jones
compute the charge density which is nice. So I'd like to put that discussion in.

Also the perdew-zunger plot in the introduction it might be nice to change the scale
because it only goes up to 0.36 for Fe in the examples of material densities that
I give. Could also add a couple Crystal structures on to the plot if they look good.

To make the Avogadro picture not completely insane we could have a triptych of 
Atomists i.e. people who were in favour of atoms perhaps Dalton, Avogadro,
and Thompson?

For d superconductivity a 5x5 block recursion could be good!

camreclibpy now a reality! Running the small fcc cluster example in a python notebook.
I've broken off the CamRecLib into a new repository as well which is now self contained.
Next steps are to create a notebook for each example and integrate an atom viewer as well
along with possibly a visualization of the way the starting vector emanates. This should
be possible with the c_api in debug mode returning the value of pmn/psi at each application
of the Hamiltonian (HOP). Adam may be able to help with this.

Also if python call backs can be written to pass in new nearest neighbour criterion, or
a new slater koster parameter than we can couple to the tb_nn library in a fairly straight
forward manner.

Starting a Math appendix to contain the interesting math bits which would
bog down the main flow of the text. Finding an interesting connection
between orthogonal polynomials, euclidean division.

If we are going to look at molecules and polymers there are some 
well developed tools here: 
https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Overview.html#what-is-it


‘First, it is related to the disposition of two electrons 
(remember, no one has ever seen an electron!): next, these electrons 
have their spins pointing in opposite directions (remember, no one 
can ever measure the spin of a particular electron!): 
then the spatial distribution of these electrons is described 
analytically with some degree of precision (remember, there is no 
way of distinguishing experimentally the density distribution of 
one electron from another!): concepts like hybridization, covalent 
and ionic structures, resonance, all appear, not one of which 
corresponds to anything that is directly measurable. 
These concepts make a chemical bond seem so real, so life-like, 
that I can almost see it. Then I wake with a shock to the 
realization that a chemical bond does not exist; it is 
figment of the imagination that we have invented, and no 
more real than the square root of —1. I will not say that 
the known is explained in terms of the unknown, 
for that is to misconstrue the sense of intellectual adventure. 
There is no explanation: there is form: there is structure: 
there is symmetry: there is growth; and there is therefore change and life.’

Found some recent and very relevant papers on the fixed points of recurrence terms
Moroz and... Alphonse! With an interesting reference to William of Orange at the beginning
of his chat. Anyway the picture is become clearing of connecting fixed points/morse topology
to the groups generating the recursion coefficients. I think the first port of call is
band edges and internal van hove singularities. The latter could act as a sorting metric
for the alloy design/Hume Rothery rules.

as well as a paper on Grainboundaries and gap states in silicon.

Getting ready to write up perturbation theory results which reminds me
why I started the Topology reading in the first place. I think 
Perturbation theory should go with the appendix and some `light'
topological demonstrations. The real topology comes in book number 2 
anyway.

So instead of doing the write up I've opend Milnor More Theory and Crowell and Fox
on Knot Theory. This, I would argue, is not pure procrastination.
