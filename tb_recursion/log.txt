Have a nice shape to the introduction now which will hopefully shape 
the rest of the book. Adding Wannier's after DFT chapter which will mainly
be the TB-NN work. The GW chapter should now be merged or followed by 
a simple GW as recursive perturbation theory with hermitian Sigma chapter. 

Need to tidy up the superconductivity discussion
and add the integrations. The recursion sketch there will be computing
$\lambda$ and $\mu$ using recursion theory maybe for Tungsten?

Same with the metallurgy chapter I think elasticity, phonon anomalies 
or defect calculations should be plenty in the way of examples.

Then we can move on to decorating and finalizing: 

I would like a figure of Avogadro.
Some nice path hopping pictures for the recursion method.

Some Nice TB/DFT images
GW self-energy operator.

References in the text with links to CamRecLibPy examples should also be made.
