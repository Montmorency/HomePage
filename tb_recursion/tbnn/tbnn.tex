\chapter{Tight Binding with Machine Learning and Inference}
\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we demonstrate how the theory and techniques of 
Chap.~\ref{chap:invariance} can be applied to real material systems.
First {\it ab initio} data is generated to approximate the electronic 
states of the material, this data is then summarized in a tight binding
model, and material properties are computed.


\section{Matching Moments}
One method for determining is by inferring the tight binding parameters
by trying to reproduce the moments of the density of states calculated 
{\it ab initio}.

\begin{equation}
\mu^{j}_{n,l} = \frac{\int E^{j}N_{n,l}(E)dE}{\int N_{n,l}(E)dE}
\end{equation}
