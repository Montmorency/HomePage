\chapter{The Local Atomic Environment}
\label{chap:invariance}
\section{Introduction}
If you travel in certain materials scientists circles there is a book 
that comes up for discussion and is  
generally referred to only as \textit{Vol.~35}. 
The full title of this remarkable book 
is \textit{Solid State Physics: Advances in Research and Applications Volume 35}. 
The editors of the series were Henry Ehrenreich, whom we met in the previous chapter,
Frederick Seitz and David Turnbull.
It appeared in 1980 and is dedicated to, `the exposition of real space methods.' 

What is meant by, `...the exposition of real space methods.'?
Some skeptics may object to the term `real space'. After all, what other type of space is there? 
To these skeptics `real space' may recall the `campaign for real time' in Douglas
Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. In that work time travel has become
so prevalent that the continuity of history had become dangerously 
fractured and reality was becoming intolerably improbable. As a result an organization
was founded to campaign for restrictions on time travel. 

A similar issue could be argued to have developed in materials science 
with regards to the use of reciprocal space instead of real space.  
Reciprocal spaces arises naturally in crystalline systems. 
The periodic structure of crystals means a natural mathematical representation of
wavefunctions, electronic charge densities, and the lattices themeselves can be found 
as an expansion of those quantities by sets of sinusoidal waves. Each sinusoidal wave
can be indexed by a wavenumber $\lambda_n$, e.g. $\sin\lambda_{n} x$. The index $\lambda_n$
has units of inverse length, i.e. a reciprocal length, whence, reciprocal space. 
Discussions of the periodic structure are simpler if we make reference directly
to these wavenumbers.

In fact, one of the primary early expositors of the
real space approach to electronic structure was Jacques Friedel who joked
many materials scientists could only think about crystals in reciprocal space
`owing to an overdose of X-ray scattering.' \cite{sutton15}.
Similar to the campaign for real time these notes 
are part of a manifesto for an organization which 
advocates the use of `real space methods'.

So from the earliest days of X-ray crystallography and Bragg reflections
researchers became accustomed to working in reciprocal space.
Reciprocal space techniques have proved essential in other branches of science
like determination of protein structures. 
In reciprocal space the characteristic diffraction spots give indications of the symmetry groups
and the spacing of the atomic planes. Some honest detective work can then be done to 
deduce the most likely structure. (See Ref.~\cite{dickinson23} for an  early example of the process
of determining crystal structure from xray data in this example Molybdenite (MoS$_{2}$).

The crystalline structure means that the electrons experience 
a periodic potential. It is also useful to estimate the wavelengths
associated with an electron and and some atomic nuclei. In thermal equilibrium
we can partition the energy between the translational degrees of freedom of our
particles and use De Broglie's relationship to estimate the wavelength 
associated with the particle:
%
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{mk_{B}T}}
\end{equation}
%

\begin{tabular}{|c| c| c| c| c|}

%
The significant difference in mass of the electron and the atomic nucleii
dictates the change in the wavelength. 
Which is essentially a three dimensional diffraction grating of atoms
with spacing on the order of $10^{-10}m$ we can expect significant 
interference effects. Bl\"ochs theorem allows us to enumerate and solve for the 
eigenvalues of the crystalline electronic system in reciprocal space as well. 

So, for perfectly periodic systems reciprocal space is a natural representation to work in. However
what gains are made in mathematical convenience leads to costs in physical intuition. 
It is difficult to picture an electron delocalized across an entire crystal.
We also frequently encounter situations where the periodicity of the lattice is 
disrupted.

Let us adopt the perspective of a pragmatic chemist. The pragmatic chemist has the periodic table which
assigns to each atom a certain number of electrons. The pragmatic chemist knows that the valence electrons
are the only important electrons. The pragmatic chemists counts valence electrons on
one atom, valence electrons on another atom, and then asks what happens when we place those two atoms
next to each other. For small molecules the hope is this approach will lead somewhere: simple arguments
based on `closed shells' and the shapes of atomic orbitals helps rationalize a significant
body of observed chemical behaviour.

However as the size of the system increases from that of simple molecules
some account must be made for the diffusion of the electrons
throughout the system and their correlation across large distances. 
It turns out accounting for diffusion and correlation is essential to 
obtaining an accurate quantitative and qualitative picture of the 
physics of the solid state.  

To develop this picture we require an intermediate representation between a strictly localized
picture of bonding electrons attached to individual atoms and Bl\"och's picture of 
electron waves delocalized throughout an entire crystal.

It is just such a viewpoint that has been developed comprehensively in Vol.~35.
This chapter collects some of the ideas presented in that text as well as
work, both theoretical and applied, that appeared afterwards.
By the end of this chapter 
the reader should have some sense of the philosophy, theory,
and the technique for calculating materials properties in real space.
The method is applicable in situations where Bl\"och's theorem no longer holds;
a situation which arises at surfaces, in glasses, in disordered structures, 
in structures with impurities,vacancies, defects, and dislocations. In short the method is applicable 
to any realistic physical situation and in all cases of engineering relevance.

%In this chapter we will assume we are given a 
%Hamiltonian in a suitably localized format. 
%That is it only involves terms between
%an atom and its closest neighbours. 
%In Chapter~\ref{chap:gw}
%and Chapter~\ref{chap:wannier} we will look at ways of generating such a Hamiltonian.
%Given such a Hamiltonian Haydock's Recursion method then gives a rapidly convergent 
%scheme for computing quantities of interest. 
%One of the primary quantities of interest 
%is the density of states (DOS) and the partial density of states (PDOS). 
%This data tabulates the permissible energies that electronic states can take in a solid
%and is the condensed matter analogue of the hydrogen spectral lines. The way this quantity
%is generated is also intrinsically local so we obtain information about the electronic
%environment around an individual atom.
%Topics that are often discussed at the beginning of introductory physics courses include:
%the study of black body radiation, photoemission phenomenon, De Broghlie waves,
%electron diffraction experiments and the structure of the hydrogen atom.
%Examination of these topics constitute a suitable foundation 
%for understanding the formalism and experimental justification for the theory.
%It is natural to hope that from the understanding of the electronic states of hydrogen the
%understanding of larger atomic systems, containing progressively more electrons, might emerge. 
%However as the number of electrons in a system grows the wave function becomes 
%somewhat unwieldly to work with and the accurate evaluation of the 
%electron-electron repulsions becomes more difficult. Computers provide a route
%to numerical solutions of the equations governing the behaviour of these systems.
%Computer simulations are commonly performed these days in many branches of physics, 
%chemistry, engineering, and biology. The use of computers to solve Schr\"odinger's 
%equation for electrons in crystals has led to the proliferation of the 
%many, many tribes of electronic structure theory. 
%The tribes are well known to practitioners in the field. A non-exhaustive list
%of some of these we can name here as: tight binding and linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO), 
%linear muffing tin orbitals (LMTO), plane waves and pseudopotentials, Gaussian orbitals, and 
%Kohn-Kuttinger-Rostiger theory.
%While successful in a number of respects numerical work can be tedious 
%and, more importantly, can obscure underlying
%mechanisms. There is also a tendency for people working in numerical methods to become 
%excessively obsessed with algorithmic details and, most importantly,
%the results of a single calculation may not provide a framework that accounts for a range
%of phenomenon in homologous series of materials where only slight adjustment of the physical
%interaction parameters change. (This speaks to Ehrenreich third observation 
%that results for homologous materials should be computed
%wherever possible and the results should be compared). 

An additional goal of this chapter is to indicate where the computational 
routines in the \texttt{CamRecLib} package can be employed in the service of
real space calculations. 
For many of the sections in this chapter there is an associated example
which the reader can work through using the attached computational library.
The reader should find these examples can be adapted to perform `industrial' calculations 
for whatever applications may interest them in a fairly straightforward manner.
The routines cover the calculation of: local density of states,
off-diagonal elements of the Green's function, block recursion, 
perturbation theory, and non-orthogonal recursion. All these terms will 
be explained in the following.

Before we start calculating though we discuss the physical and mathematical
justification for a description of a materials 
properties in terms of the local environment. This justification stems from
what Volker Heine has called the `Invariance Principle'. Once we are satisfied
with the statement of this principle we can then work through
the derivation of the recursion method and the algebra underlying its application.

Finally, it should be mentioned that the recursion method
is closely connected to the theory of continued fractions and orthogonal polynomials.
The necessary mathematical exposition has been included in Appendix~\ref{appen} 
which the reader may wish to cross reference as required. 

\section{The Invariance Theorem}
\label{sec:invariance}
Vol.~35 begins with Heine's presentation of the invariance
theorem. The essential realization which underpins the theory is that
there is a formal analogy between electrons considered as waves in a solid 
and the black body spectrum of electromagnetic radiation in a hollow cavity.
The existence of this analogy means we can apply a central theorem 
derived for the blackbody spectrum by Weyl and Von Laue which states that
the local properties of the system are formally insensitive to the boundary 
conditions of our system. It is this theorem which allows us to construct
solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation for electrons in a solid built
out of the local electronic environment.

The origins of this result go back to the early days of quantum theory.
We will discuss the results of Hermann Weyl, a student of Hilbert and his school 
at G\"ottingen,and Max von Laue. 

For some context these results were arrived at in light of Plank and Einsteins 
work in radiation theory and special relativity had been established.
The work was contemporaneous with Von Laue's nobel winning discovery of X-ray diffraction
by crystals. A little historical digression is merited here.

Ewald, who also made important contributions to X-ray crystallography,
authored a biographical sketch of Von Laue. Ewalds suggests that it was assumed 
by many scientists in Germany around 1910 that
the thermal motion of atoms would obscure any clear diffraction resonances indicating
crystalline structure. Von Laue was of the opinion that the experiment should be tried anyway, 
with and the experimental work was carried out by W. Fridrich and P Knipping \cite{ewald}.
As it happened they were able to obtain clear diffraction patterns and
Von Laue was quickly able to provide a mathematical interpretation of the
diffraction spots (no doubt others modified their theoretical objections 
to demonstrate that the diffraction must occur). 
Von Laue's formulation in terms of a three dimensional 
diffraction grating was quickly complimented by the interpretations of 
W. H. and W.L. Bragg and their essentially equivalent formulation 
of the scattering as ocurring off of densely packed atomic planes.

Ewald articulates the impact of Von Laue and the Braggs' work  beautifully:
%
\begin{quote}
Together, these two ideas (those of Von Laue and Bragg) led to the construction of the 
X-ray spectrometer by means of which plane after plane of a crystal
structure could be investigated and measured out in terms of known wavelengths... 
to unravel one crystal structure after the other and to a school of
scientists who, whether they came from physics or chemistry, were mainly interested
in deciphering the atomic arrangement in crystals and thereby to delve deeper 
than ever before ino the mysteries of chemical interaction.
\end{quote}
%
Although we started out this chapter hoping to move away from reciprocal space
formulations, and still intend to, we are happy to pay tribute to the fundamental
role it plays in diffraction and the elucidation of the atomic structure of materials.

In any macroscopic material system there are a huge number of degrees of freedom.
If we are no longer allowing ourselves to use periodic functions to reduce the
numbers of degrees of freedom in the system we will have to account for each one
individually.In order to make progress certain quantities are required that effectively
characterize the physics. One central quantity is the electronic density of states:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:dos}
n(E) = \sum_{n}\delta(E-E_{n}).
\end{eqnarray}
%
This function accounts for all the permissible eigenenergies for electrons 
in a material system. In an atomic system, for example for an hydrogen atom, the density of
states will have single delta functions located at all the permissible energy levels
of the hydrogen atom. These can be computed to good accuracy fairly easily using analytic techniques. 
In a solid, as one might expect, involving many atoms arranged in complex patterns 
the spectrum becomes more complicated; this ensures continuing work 
for materials scientist who can calculate and interpret the distribution of permissible energies.

Eq.~\ref{eq:dos} involves a sum over a macroscopic number $(10^{23})$ of permissible energies.
Our objective is to restrict this quantity so we can reason about our system based on 
the local atomic environment. To this end we introduce the local density of states (LDOS)
\cite{friedel54}:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ldos}
n(E,\r) = \sum_{n} |\psi_{n}(\r)|^{2}\delta(E-E_{n}).
\end{equation}
%
The difference between Eq.~\ref{eq:dos} and Eq.~\ref{eq:ldos} 
is we have introduced the electronic wave functions $\psi_{n}(\r)$.
The sum over n is still over the macroscopic number of electrons but we have introduced
a coordinate system with $\r$. If we can demonstrate that the sum evaluated at 
the point $\r$ is insensitive to changes in the systems more than a few wavelengths 
away we will have obtained a huge reduction
in the computational effort required. To accomplish 
this we must exploit the analogy with blackbody radiation
and enlist the help of Weyl and Von Laue.

The local density of modes for black-body radiation can be written\cite{annett94}:
%
\begin{equation}
\rho(\omega,\r)= \sum_{i} |\bra \r| \psi_{i}\ket|^{2}\delta(\omega-\omega_{i}),
\end{equation}
%
with $\psi_{i}$ the eigenfunction (of an electromagnetic wave or a wavefunction) 
for an eigenvalue $\omega_{i}$.

The demonstrations of the required invariance principle according to Weyl and Von
Laue proceed along different lines. For our purposes we favour Von Laue's derivation
but menation a few points in connection with Weyl's work.

Weyl, who presented his results in 1912, 
as a student of Hilbert's was extremely well versed in the 
ideas of vector spaces and Green's functions. 
He demonstrated that the the total density
of modes is independent of the shape of the cavity so long as the
radiation is contained in a cavity with dimensions greater than the wavelengths
under consideration\cite{weyl1912}. The mathematics he employs appear the more modern
compared with Von Laue's classical demonstration.
This frequently cited paper by Weyl
translates as,`Asymptotic distribution law 
of the eigenvalues of linear partial differential equations with an application
to the \textit{Holraumstrahlung}'. The germanic compound noun 
translating literally as `radiation of a cavity with a small hole in it'. 
This is often, although more obliquely, called a `black body' in English. 

The interested reader, unless they wish to tackle Weyl's German and
Green's function tour de force is recommended to read Weyl's later reflection on 
the work in Ref.~\cite{weyl50} where he sketches the derivation of the asymptotic
behaviour of the eigenvalues using more familiar terms and notation 
(as well as doing it in English).
At this point we wish to stress only that Weyl's asymptotic relations 
\textit{ are not restricted to electromagnetic wave
phenomenon, in fact, the asymptotic properties are valid in any
situation where we
have a linear wave equation leading to vibrations on an oscillating membrane:
electromagnetic, electronic, or elastic. }
As we shall see many of the techniques described in this chapter can
be applied without any significant modification anywhere we have a linearized
wave equation.

Von Laue's derivation of the invariance principle originates 
to a much greater degree in experiment and physical
instituion then Weyl's approach which was of a purely mathematical character. 

\textit{The essential point is that 
while the normal modes of a system can be quite sensitive to disturbances the 
local density of modes, when averaged over a small frequency interval, 
is a stable quantity that is insensitive to disturbances more than a 
few wavelengths away.}

\section{Green's Functions}
\label{sec:matchinggreens}
The following treatment has been developed by Heine which in turn follows the 
work of Garcia-Moliner and Rubio, and, Velicky and Bartos, Refs.~\cite{garcia69, velicky71, garcia71},
along with the work of Inglesfield in Refs.~\cite{inglesfield71,inglesfield81}.

An intuitive grasp of the theory of matching Green's functions is a key component of a material
modellers outlook. The theme will be returned to time and again throughout these notes and in
practical applications. Entire subfields of materials science which at first appear distinct 
are in effect just different methods of solving the Schr\"odinger equation in a convenient
basis for one region and matching it at the boundary to a convenient basis 
for a solution in another region. Embedding one potential in another, treating impurities,
the interaction between valence electrons and core electrons all
involve in one way or another matching Green's functions across a surface.

The perspective that Heine introduces in Vol. 35 of Solid State Physics and the derivation
he presents there is worth working through in full. We will only outline the final form
the solutions should take with an example.

Let us consider the pseudopotential method.
This approach is reliant on finding decent approximations to the Green's function in one
region $G_{A}$ near the atoms and another $G_{B}$ that is valid in the interstitial
regions between atoms. The plane waves
in the interstitial regions must match the Green's function for the atomic system
at a particular radial cutoff and energy. If a function can be found that 
describes the scattering of these waves across a suitable energy range the approximation 
is a good one and the matching of the two systems will be successful. This
is represented schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:pseudosplit}.
%
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./invariance/pseudosplit.png}
\caption{Schematic representation of decomposing the Green's function into a local atom centered
Green's function, $G_{A}$, and the Green's function in the interstitial region $G_{B}$.
A pseudopotential is a function that allows $G_{B}$ to be represented as a relatively
smooth function of position capable of efficient description in terms of plane waves.
The functions must match at the cutoff for $G_{A}$ to the solutions for 
atomic wave functions. Another approach would involve matching the $G_{A}$ 
and $G_{B}$ explicitly at each stage of the calculation until self-consistency is obtained.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Equations written in the form of \ref{eq:green1a} are of the type required for the invariance theorem namely:
%
\begin{equation}
G(\r,\r';E) = G_{A}(\r,\r';E) + {\rm boundary ~ corrections},
\end{equation}
%
where we have restored the energy argument.

These considerations provide a reasonable mathematical framework for 
investigating electronic structure from the point of view of the local environment.
Indeed, as Heine himself says: 

\begin{quote}
The importance of this approach would lie in the fact that
one has a single entity $G_{A}$ to represent an element in anything 
from a small molecule to a complex alloy.
\end{quote}

%
Heine's ambition turns on this:
%
\begin{quote}
We see now that the trick in the new formulation of quantum 
mechanics is not just to express measurable quantities in terms of 
G, {\it but in terms of some appropriate small parts of G that can be solved 
for and computed separately from all the unwanted remainder of G.}
\end{quote}
%
This relies, again in analogy with black bodies, on the Green's
function in a certain region of space being independent of the size and shape
of the container and the boundary conditions.

\section{Slater-Koster Tight Binding}
Let us denote the translation operator $\hat{T}$
as the operator which displaces all the coordinates of a vector 
by a crystal lattice vector $\R_{i}$ we require 
firstly that $[\hat{T},\hat{H}]=0$, i.e. that the 
translation operator commutes with the Hamiltonian. This also
has the consequence that the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian
must be eigenvectors of the translation operator. 

Bloch's theorem encapsulates this idea. When a translation operator acts 
on a Bloch state of a crystal the wavefunction is multiplied by a scalar
value $e^{i\k\cdot\R}$: i.e. the condition for a vector to be an
eigenvector.

If a basis set of atomic orbitals $\phi_{n}(\r-\R_{i})$
is placed on each atom in the crystal an un-normalized Bloch sum can be 
written as $\sum_{\R_{i}} e^{i\k\cdot\R_{i}}\phi_{n}(\r-\R_{i})$. For
a given $\k$ there will be off-diagonal elements between Bloch sums
for different atomic orbitals.

The matrix elements between Bloch sums (where L\"owdin orbitals $\psi_{n}$ 
are used instead of LCAOs, \cite{lowdin62}) gives:
%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\R_{j}} e^{i\k\cdot(\R_{j}-\R_{i})}\times\int \psi^{*}_{n}(\r-\R_{i})H\psi_{m}(\r-\R_{j})dV
\end{equation}
%
The development of computers means the secular equations can be solved 
at arbitrary $\k$ points. \footnote{The paper explicitly anticipates that the integrals and Bloch 
sums could be performed with the help of computers: ``The possibility is not excluded 
that eventually ways will be found to do this work by means of high-speed computers, but
it will certainly be quite out of the question without such help."} 

The work of Slater-Koster demonstrates, in an intuitive fashion, how localized atomic
states, when modulated by a wave of the form $e^{i\k\cdot\R}$ can interfere 
(constructively or deconstructively) to allow charge to accumulate in different 
spatial patterns between atoms, and how the variation in the eigenvalues of $H_{\k}$
can give rise to band structures. Determining the coefficients involved in the 
tight binding energy integrals is somewhat involved. The Coordinate system needs
to be set up and the integrals performed for different combinations of spherical
harmonics on neighbouring atoms. Ref.~\cite{sharma79,podolsky04} both give explicit
expression for generating the coefficients programmatically.

The determination of the integration constants is a problem unto itself.
Tight binding parameters for the transition metals can be extracted from 
a number of places: tight binding parameters that span the transition
metal range can be found in Refs. \cite{nieminen76}, \cite{pettifor77} and \cite{jepsen75, andersen77, harrison80}.
Harrison has also published a set of universal parameters for s-p bonded structures.

\section{Transition Metal Tight Binding}
\label{sec:tmtb}
Bullet discusses some of the problems with treating d electrons in a tight binding 
formalism (Sec. IV 13 Solid State Physics Vol. 35). Fig.~\ref{fig:datoms} demonstrates
one of the main issues arising with d electrons:
%
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{./invariance/resonant-datoms.pdf}
\caption{The possibility of free electron states, in the interstitial region, 
resonating with atom centered localized states. The centrifugal components of the 
atomic d wave scattering channel can combine with
the atomic potential to produce a bound electronic state at some energy $E^{0}_{l}$ for an atomic system.
In a crystal the atomic periodic potential can be such that electrons can be bound in an
atomic d-like state can have the same energy as tunnel through the barrier localizing 
them and mix with free electron plane wave states. This dual character of the wave 
function, with localized components and extended components, requires careful 
detangling to return to a tight binding description. This difficulty 
stems from the presence of an energy resonance 
complicating the process of choosing the coefficients of the tight binding matrix. 
For the optimal, energy independent, set of coefficients that can be 
chosen see the work of Pettifor. There is a close parallel with the resonant
scattering of d-wave electrons in materials and Feshbach resonances Ref.~\cite{chin10}.
[Figure after D.W. Bullet Solid State Physics Vol. 35 pg. 197.]}
\end{figure}
%

From pseudopotentials we are familiar with having to match the logarithmic energy
derivative at some cutoff radius. Usually found by integrating the radial
Schr\"odinger equation to find $u_{l}(r,\epsilon)$ and matching the logarithmic derivatives:
%
\begin{equation}
L_{l}(\epsilon) \equiv \frac{u'_{l}(r_{0},\epsilon)}{u_{l}(r_{0},\epsilon)} = \frac{\kappa[j'_{l}
(\kappa r_{0}) - \tan \eta_{l} n'_{l}(\kappa r_{0})]} {j_{l}(\kappa r_{0}) - \tan \eta_{l} n_{l}'(\kappa r_{0})]},
\end{equation}
%
wherer:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phaseshift}
\tan \eta_{l} = \frac{\kappa j'_{l} - L_{l}j_{l}}{\kappa n'_{l} - L_{l}n_{l}}.
\end{equation}

In terms of the energy and width the l=2 phase shift Eq.~\ref{eq:phaseshift} 
can be written:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dshift}
\tan \eta_{d} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}W(\epsilon)}{\epsilon_{d}-\epsilon}.
\end{equation}
%
The uncertainty principle allows for the estimation of the rest
time for an electron on an atomic d state to be around $\hbar/W_{d}\approx 10^{-14}$s \cite{friedel73}.
\footnote{Ref.~\cite{friedel73}, written in 1973, provides us with another example
of the early impact electronic computers were making in the field. Friedel  compares 
the relative merits of `muffin tin' type calculations and tight binding approximations.
The former approach he describes as leading, ``to fairly exact if cumbersome
computations, and has thus had the support of the `computers lobby'". The conclusion
puts forward a number of points in favour of tight binding approaches as 
being suitable for studying complex phases and lattice defects,
latent heats of phase changes, elastic constants and electron-phonon couplings.}

The strong centrifugal contribution to the
atomic scattering potential from higher angular moment channels means the effective potential
can create a bound atomic state. In a solid the energy of this bound state can match the 
energy of a free electron state in the interstitial region and there will
be resonant tunneling between the two states. This results in the hybridization of d states
and plane waves. 

This means an appropriate model Hamiltonian must account for the various states as
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:d-hamiltonian}
H =  d-d  |&  d-PW \\
     PW-D |& PW-PW 
\end{align}
%
where d-d and PW-PW are of the tight-binding and plane-wave 
pseudopotential form and hybridization occurring in the 
off-diagonal elements. The dual characteristic of transition metals
tightly bound d-electrons and diffuse s-p orbitals hybridizing 
accounts for the difficulties in describing their electronic properties.


The $dd\sigma$ terms behave roughly as \cite{pettifor71}:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pettifor}
dd\sigma \approx \frac{-5W\cos\kappa_{d}R}{\kappa_{d}R}
\end{equation}
%
If we write our basis functions in terms of localized orbitals
Eq.~\ref{eq:pettifor} suggests our Hamiltonian matrix will be 
populated by a huge number of off-diagonal matrix elements which can't be neglected. If 
the energy is equal to $k^{2}$ constructive interference occurs and the energy summation
diverges with off-diagonal matrix elements between all d states on remote atoms becoming
significant. This isn't entirely surprising. We are considering a periodic crystalline solid
and the eigenfunctions of this crystal are extended throughout. The off-diagonal elements
in a coordinate space representation reflect the long range order of the material and
preservation of the phase of the electronic wave function as they move from atom to atom. See
Chapter~\ref{chap:odlro} for further discussion of this and related points.

The `best' approximations to the explicit formulas for $dd\sigma$, $dd\pi$ and $dd\delta$ and the phase
shift $d_{0}'$ of the diagonal tight-binding elements 
These difficulty have been addressed in a number of works 
\cite{hubbard67,mueller67}, \cite{hubbard68}, \cite{hubbard69} \footnote{Another computational
snapshot comes from Ref.~\cite{hubbard69}, "...smaller secular 
equations are used, taking about one second per k point on an IBM  360/65." The
main storage capacity of those machines was 524 kilobytes. See Fig.~\ref{fig:ibm360}
for a (grainy) snapshot of what that computer looked like.},
and J. Hubbard, ibid 2, 1222 (1969). The problem being to define an
energy independent Hamiltonian, amenable to tight binding for the d electrons.

Deriving an effective, tight binding, energy indepedent parameterization
of d electron structure  culminated in the work of D. G. Pettifor's \cite{pettifor69}. 
Pettifor's work produced a justifiable scheme for computing the two center tight binding integrals of Slater
and Koster, $dd\sigma$, $dd\pi$, $dd\delta$ in terms of the position and halfwidth of the resonance:
$\epsilon_0$ and $\Gamma$. It is worthwhile considering the achievement of these collected papers.
With relatively limited computing power the workers determined 
the positions of atomic eigenvalues, band widths, and the effect 
of atomic scattering potentials. In 
the course of the work a great deal of algebraic manipulation of spherical 
harmonics and plane waves is required, along with the determination
of numerical values via graphical methods. All in all a laborious but fruitful task resulting
in energy independent matrix elements localized to nearest (next nearest ) 
neighbours real and reciprocal space.

The work of Pettifor and colleagues in determining justifiable tight 
binding parameters for transitional metals, 
effectively completed by 1969, was an important prerequisite for the subsequent 
development of the recursion method in the 1970s. Generalized tables for tightbinding parameters 
across the transition metal series has been produced in Ref.~\cite{harrison80}.

%The parameters used in Ref.~\cite{burke78} are appropriate to the BCC structure.
%The tightbinding Hamiltonian only considers two center contributions, with the parameters 
%coming from Pettifor\cite{pettifor69} and rescaled to produce the observed
%bandwidth of tungsten. The parameters are given in Table~\ref{tab:dsurface}.

For ease of reference we collect here d tight-binding coefficicents
that have found there way into the literature. The choice of these parameters
is very much an example of theoretical materials science constituting a 
craft. In later chapters we will examine some of the developments that set
tight-binding and the choice of coefficients on a more definite 
theoretical framework. The Slater-Koster parameters used for FCC, BCC, 
and HCP crystals in Ref.~\cite{haydock72} are given in Table \ref{tab:pettiparams}.

Whether we are able to create a tight binding description of transition metals
depends on whether a decent, energy independent, approximation to the electronic 
structure in fcc/bcc metals can be achieved with 9x9 matrices describing 
nearest neighbour interactions of the s, p and d states, in the Slater-Koster 
form or derived from electronic states localized according to some 

\subsection{Kelly Tight Binding}

An example from Kelly helps to make the application of the tightbinding scheme clear:
%
\begin{quote}
As input data we require a convenient local representation of $H$. In simple crystals,
this is most easily given in terms of interactions with a unit cell and between neighboring cells.
For a FCC transition metal we have nine orbitals (1 s-orbital, 3 p-orbitals, and 5 d-orbitals) per site, 
and a diagonal 9x9 matrix for the self-energies of these orbitals. Twelve 9x9 matrices 
suffice to describe the interaction of any atom with its nearest neighbours.
\end{quote}
%

The actual operation of $H|u_{n}\ket$,which has been discussed in a general way so far, 
can be written as:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fullhamhop}
H|u_{n}\ket = \sum_{i\alpha, j\beta}a_{n i\alpha }(\bra j\beta |H| i\alpha \ket)|j \beta \ket.
\end{equation}
%
The summation in Eq.~\ref{eq:fullhamhop} does not run over every matrix element of the Hamiltonian.
Instead we appeal to the local formulation of the interactions so that
H can be stored and manipulated as a sparse matrix. To make this explicit let us 
introduce an index $z$ which runs over the nearest-neighbours of 
site $i$ with which the orbitals, $\alpha$, interact:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hop}
H|u_{n}\ket = \sum_{i\alpha, j_{z}\beta_{z}}a_{n i\alpha}(\bra j_{z}\beta_{z}|H_{z}|i\alpha\ket)|j_{z}\beta_{z}\ket.
\end{equation}
%
There are no restrictions on the number of orbitals per site, or on the range of interactions that can be
incorporated, these only impact on the efficiency of the method and the validity of the original assumptions
about the pre-dominance of the local atomic environment. Computationally Eq.~\ref{eq:hop} is at the
heart of all recursion calculations and the interested reader could at this point inspect the subroutine
\texttt{HOP} in \texttt{CamRecLib} to understand how the neighbour lists, matrix elements, and interaction
vectors are handled.

\section{Recursion Method}
The principle of the recursion method is to obtain a convergent expression 
for an element of the Green's function:
%
\begin{equation}
G(E) = \bra\phi_{i\alpha}|[E + i\delta -H]^{-1}|\phi_{i\alpha}\ket.
\end{equation}
%

The Green's function can be immediately related to the local density of states as:
%
\begin{equation}
n_{i\alpha}(E) = -\frac{1}{\pi} {\rm Im}\bra \phi_{i\alpha} |[E + i\delta -H]^{-1}|\phi_{i\alpha}\ket
\end{equation}
%

The state $\chi$ which we project on to can be made up of some linear combination 
of the local basis set $\phi_{\alpha l}$, which, in turn, could be local atom centered orbitals, bond orbitals, 
Wannier functions, atomic diplacements, or any localized quantity we wish to define. The method is thus
applicable to a wide range of problems in condensed matter. In short what we wish to examine
is determined by the choice of $\chi$.

\subsection{Mathematical Origin}
The trick of the recursion method, if you like to think of things in terms of tricks, 
or its generating feature, if you prefer, is that from the outset the `Greenian', the matrix element
of the Green's function we are interested in, is restricted to a particular matrix element: 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:greenian}
G_{00}(E) = \bra u_{0}|[E-H]^{-1}|u_{0}\ket 
\end{equation}
%
As Heine puts it in his chapter:
%
\begin{quote}
Note that we do not want the whole of the inverse matrix $[E-H]^{-1}$, 
\emph{only one element}, and on this the whole method depends. In physics we do not
usually inquire about the whole of life, but about one particular matrix element (at a time) and we have chosen
$u_{0}$ so that Eq.~\ref{eq:greenian} gives us what, to put it crudely, we want.
\end{quote}

If we are given a tridiagonal matrix of the form:
%
\begin{equation}
H = \begin{bmatrix}
a_0 & b_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  ...\\
b_1 & a_1 & b_2 & 0 & 0 &  ...\\
0 & b_2 & a_2 & b_3 & 0 &  ...\\
0 & 0 & b_3 & a_3 & b_4 & ...\\
0 & 0 & 0 & b_4 & a_4 & ...  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_5 & ... 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

%
The determinants and sub-determinants of the matrix can be nested:
%
$$
\newcommand*{\temp}{\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{b_1}}
\newcommand*{\tempa}{\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{b_2}}
\newcommand*{\tempb}{\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{b_3}}
\newcommand*{\tempc}{\multicolumn{1}{|c}{0}}
\begin{array}{|ccccccc}
\cline{0-5}
a_0 & b_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  & D_0 \\ \cline{2-6} 
\temp & a_1 & b_2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & D_1 \\ \cline{3-6} 
0 & \tempa & a_2 & b_3 & 0 & 0 & D_2 \\ \cline{4-6}
0 & \tempc &  \tempb &  a_3 & b_4 & ... & D_3.
\end{array}
$$

Eq.~\ref{eq:greenian} can be rewritten in terms of its determinants:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:greendet}
\bra u_{0}|[E-H]^{-1}|u_{0}\ket = \frac{{\rm det}|D_{1}|}{{\rm det}|D_{0}|},
\end{equation}
%
or, by flipping the fraction on its head:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:greendet}
\bra u_{0}|[E-H]^{-1}|u_{0}\ket = \frac{1}{\frac{{\rm det}|D_{0}|}{{\rm det}|D_{1}|}}.
\end{equation}
%
Appeal is then made to Cauchy \index{Cauchy}\footnote{Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy FRS FRSE (21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857)} 
for the following expansion:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy}
{\rm det}|D_{0}| = (E-a_{0}){\rm det}|D_{1}|-b^{2}_{1}{\rm det}|D_{2}|
\end{equation}
%
and when generalized to determinants for $|D_{n}|$, $|D_{n+1}|$, and $|D_{n+2}|$:
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\rm det}|D_{n}|}{{\rm det}|D_{n+1}|} = E-a_{n}-\frac{b^{2}_{n+1}}{\frac{{\rm det}|D_{n+1}|}{{\rm det}|D_{n+2}|}}
\end{equation}

\footnote{
\index{C. Lanczos} J. Res. Natl. Bur. Stand. 45, 255 (1950) 
used the chain model in numerical work as a way of diagonalizing matrices
that could be implemented efficiently in a computer.
Chebyshev used chain models for approximating functions on an interval
P. L. Chebyshev, Bull. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Petersbourg 1, 193 (1859)}

The coefficients of the continued fraction can be obtained from
a three term recurrence relation:
%
\begin{equation}
b_{n+1}|u_{n+1}\ket = H |u_{n}\ket - a_{n}|u_{n}\ket - b_{n}|u_{n-1}\ket
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{equation}
a_{n} = \bra u_{n}|H|u_{n} \ket,
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
b_{n} = \bra u_{n}|H|u_{n-1} \ket.
\end{equation}

This at least is the rationale given in Vol.~35. In the appendix we pursue an
alternative derivation of the recursion method that makes the connection
with some different mathematical techniques a little more explicit. For the connection
to tridiagonal matrices and expansions in terms of determinants
is good enough to satisfy our mathematical curiousity.

\section{Analytic Recursion}
\subsection{The Constant Chain}
The simplest chain model that can be handled analytically is the constant chain and it
serves as the paradigm of all the recursion calculations that will be undertaken. 
The constant chain corresponds to the general continued fraction written:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:constantchain}
G_{0}(E) = \cfrac{1}{E-a_{0}-\cfrac{b_{1}^2}{E-a_{1}-\cfrac{b_{2}^{2}}{E-a_{2}-\cfrac{b_{3}^{2}}{...}}}},
\end{equation}
%
where $a_{0}=a_{1}=...=a_{n}=a$ and $b_{0}=b_{1}=...=b_{n}=b$. 
%
In this chain an electron experiences the same pull to 
every site on the chain, and can hop from one site to 
the next with the same hopping amplitude $b^{2}_{n}$. 
%
That all the coefficients are the same means a closed 
form solution can easily be found by recognizing that 
Eq.~\ref{eq:constantchain} can be written as:
%
\begin{equation}
G_{0}(E) = \frac{1}{E-a-b^{2}G_{0}(E)},
\end{equation}
%
and rearranged to give:
%
\begin{equation}
G_{0}(E) = (\frac{E-a}{2b^{2}}) \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}(\frac{E-a}{b^{2}})^{2} - \frac{1}{b^{2}}}.
\end{equation}

The argument of the Green's function is $E + i\delta$, for positive 
energies the negative root is chosen and for negative energies 
the positive root is chosen. This gives the real
and imaginary part of the Green's function plotted 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:gfconstchain}.
%
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
{\graphicspath{{./invariance/chain_figs/}}\input{./invariance/chain_figs/chain_plot.tex}}
\caption{Real and imaginary parts of the Green's function for the constant chain.\label{fig:gfconstchain}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
The constant chain yields an analytic solution. All the coefficients of the continued
fraction are known and the recursion relation can be solved exactly. 

%In practice
%the computation of the $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ terms is truncated after some number.
%The function chosen to approximate the remaining coefficients is discussed in
%Refs.~\cite{haydock84, haydock85}.

A great deal of interesting physics can be obtained directly from the chain model. 
For instance, to couple an impurity to a constant chain we allow the first two coefficients $a_{0}$ and $b_{1}$ to vary, 
and the rest of the chain remains constant. This leads to the expression:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:defectchain}
G(E) = \frac{1/b_{1}}{\frac{E-a_{0}}{b_{1}} - G_{0}(E)}.
\end{equation}
%
There are a few different cases depending on the relative magnitude of $a_0$ 
and $b_{1}$ and the chain parameters $a$ and $b$.
We plot the behaviour of the function for a few different choices of coupling parameters
$b_{1}$, and the relative position of the defect state $a_0$ in Fig.\ref{fig:gfdefect}. 
We will return to the idea of coupling single particle states to bands in Chap.~\ref{chap:manybodyrec}. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:inband} the defect state energy is placed inside the energy range of the band. The
results for different couplings $b_{1}$ are plotted.
%
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
{\graphicspath{{./invariance/chain_figs/}}\input{./invariance/chain_figs/inband_plot.tex}}
\caption{Defect chain model, Eq.~\ref{eq:defectchain}, with $a_{0}$ chosen to be 
within the band of energies for the constant chain. The strength of the coupling between the chain 
and the defect, $b_1$, is varied. For well matched systems the density of states splits 
into two resonances corresponding to bound and antibound states. \label{fig:impurity}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

For $a_{0}$ outside the energy range of the band, the coupling to the band shifts the position
of the pole from $a_{0}$ and adjusts the areas under the two curves. Where there is 
near matching of the chain and the defect the function changes rapidly for small
variations in the coupling parameters.
%

{\graphicspath{{./invariance/chain_figs/}}\input{./invariance/chain_figs/adsorbate_plot.tex}}
\caption{Coupling of an adsorbate to a constant chain model Eq.~\ref{eq:defectchain}. 
In this case $a_{0}$ is chosen to be outside the band formed by the chain.
Where there is strong coupling to the chain two distinct resonances appear.
The blue and green curves correspond to couplings of $b_{1}=2b$ and $b_{1}=b/10$ respectively.
\label{fig:gfconstchain}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
In cases where the defect state is far removed and only weakly coupled to the band
there is only a small renormalization of the pole from $a_{0}$ and redistribution of the weight across the band.
This will be discussed more in Chap.\ref{chap:manybodyrec} in the context of single particle states
interacting with plasmon bands and the continuum.

\section{The Cambridge Recursion Library: \texttt {CamRecLib}}
Moving from analytic chain models to material systems with different atoms requires specification
of the Hamiltonian. The choice of the tight binding parameters was discussed in the first half of this
chapter. For present purposes the Slater-Koster tight binding parameters for the interaction of 
d-electrons should be sufficient to demonstrate the important features of typical recursion type calculation.
In subsequent chapters we will prefer the use of tight binding parameters based on Wannier functions.

\subsection{Integrals of the Density of States}
%
As will be seen, and is perhaps already known to the reader, nothing is perfect. The
recursion method for all its many strengths has an issue: the chain must be terminated
somewhere. In an extended system only so many moments can be computed in practice.  
This is not necessarily a defect of the method but a reflection of reality. Though
this is disappointing there is a silver lining. Integrals over the density of states
are very stable. As such any time we require an integral over the density of states
we can be quite confident in the result, similarly integrals over differences
are quite stable. This property of the recursion chains will be exploited again and again
to compute the relative stability of different structures. The details of how
integrals of continued fractions are performed is included in the appendix 
but it is highly recommended that the reader refer to Ref.~\cite{nex78}
for a formal description of the implemented techniques.

To compute the difference in energy between inequivalent structures 
one begins with the electron occupancy of a specific orbital:
%
\begin{equation}
N_{\alpha l}(E) = \int_{-\infty}^{E_{F}} n_{\alpha l}(E') dE'
\end{equation}
%

The total energy in a particular orbital:
%
\begin{equation}
U_{d} = \int_{-\infty}^{E_{F}}E'n_{\alpha l}(E') dE'
\end{equation}
%

The energy difference of two structures A and B can also be computed
to high accuracy:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:Ua}
U_{A} = \int_{-\infty}^{E_{FA}} E n_{A}(E) dE
\end{eqnarray}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:Ub}
U_{B} = \int_{-\infty}^{E_{FB}} E n_{B}(E) dE
\end{eqnarray}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:totaldos}
Z = \int_{-\infty}^{E_{FA}} n_{A}(E)dE = \int_{-\infty}^{E_{FB}}n_{B}(E)dE
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
U_{A}-ZE_{FA}= \int_{-\infty}^{E_{FA}}(E-E_{FA})n_{A}(E)dE
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
U_{B}-ZE_{FA}= \int_{-\infty}^{E_{FA}}(E-E_{FA})n_{B}(E)dE + \int_{E_{FB}}^{E_{FA}}n_{B}(E)dE
\end{equation}
%
If $n_{B}(E)$ is taken to be constant across that small energy range, the second term, in
Eq. results in a small squared term that can be dropped. Swapping $E_{FB}$ and $E_{FA}$ gives
a similar result. This justifies dropping the A index on the Fermi energy to get the
final expression \cite{johannes76}:
%
\begin{equation}
U_{A}-U_{B} = \int_{-\infty}^{E_{F}}(E-E_{F})[n_{A}(E) -n_{B}(E)]dE.
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Local Density of States}
\label{sec:fccldos}
The simplest demonstration of the Cambridge Recursion Library 
is a computation of the local density of states for an atom located at the center of a small 
Face Centered Cubic (FCC) cluster. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:cuboid} depicts a 75 atom cuboid cluster and the 
local density of states for an atom located in the middle of the cluster. 
The contribution of the electronic states to the total energy are also plotted. 
%
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./invariance/rec_examples/exrecal/combined.png}
\caption{(a) 75 atom cuboid cluster of face centered cubic (FCC) crystal. Green 
atoms are in an FCC environment, and have a complete set of FCC neighbours, grey atoms 
are surface atoms of the cluster and a have a lower coordination number.
(b) Same cluster with an extra bulk atom and two additional atoms 
placed on the surface at two different sites. 
\label{fig:cuboid}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
The density of states in Fig.~\ref{fig:fcc_dos} is computed by 11 iterations of the 
recurrence equation. This generates continued fraction coefficients
from $a_{0}$ to $a_{10}$ and $b_{0}$ to $b_{11}$. 
A basis of five d orbitals are chosen to reside on each atom 
and their interaction via the Hamiltonian is determined by the Slater-Koster parameters.
The Hamiltonian parameters and the coefficients of the continued fraction are given in Table~\ref{tab:reccoeffs}.
The total DOS in this case is computed by combining the continued fractions computed for each of the 
five starting orbitals into a single continued fraction 
(multiple sets of continued fraction coefficients can be combined via the 
routine \texttt{RECSUM} in \texttt{CamRecLib}).

atom in the middle of a small nickel cluster.\label{tab:reccoeffs}}

\end{table}

The difference in the qualities, in terms of the structure revealed, in the DOS 
is determined by the size of the cluster, the number of iterations of the
recurrence relations, the Hamiltonian, and the different termination 
scheme employed. 
\footnote{See the routines \texttt{DENCRS} and \texttt{DENSQ} 
for the square root and analytic terminator (TermDOS) schemes and \texttt{DENQD} 
for the QuadDOS termination scheme in the Cambridge Recursion Library 
\cite{nex84,haydock84,haydock85}.
The asymptotic behaviour of the continued fraction coefficients 
are determined by the presence, nature and position of singularities
in the spectrum: band gaps, delta functions,
band edges themselves, and Van Hove singularities.
There is considerable literature on the topic of termination schemes 
and the analytic structure of the asymptotic coefficients:
\cite{hodges77,bylander80,turchi82,haydock84,luchini87,glanville88,
yoshino87,yoshino88,haydock89,haydock10,alhaidari18}.
In certain cases expressions for the behaviour of the coefficients
is given in terms of sinusoidal or elliptic functions. Linear prediction techniques
have also been used to study the behaviour of the recursion coefficients in the
asymptotic region \cite{allan84}. The problem of terminating the continued fraction
is quite an involved one and the discussion is deffered to the appendix.}

\subsection{\texttt{ORPEEL}: Orbital Peeling}
Surface catalysis is a topic of immense interest in chemistry and chemical engineering.
The rate at which reactions proceed is important in industrial and biomedical 
applications. The presence of a surface disrupts the periodicity required to use Bloch's theorem,
at least in the direction normal to the surface. In real systems
The periodicity parallel to the surface is also quite likely to 
be compromised by steps, terminating dislocation loops, 
vacancies and impurities. All this is to say that where 
there is a surface there is likely to be a need for recursion
techniques.

The need for a direct calculation of binding energy between adatoms or
the binding of a defect impurity in a lattice stems from the difficulties in computing 
these quantities via the method of energy differences. Performing two total
energy calculations on systems with on the order of $10^{23}$ atoms and subtracting the
resulting numbers is not a well conditioned problem. 
The very nature of the problem suggests that exploiting symmetries
will not greatly simplify things.

Relevant work on surfaces using the recursion method can be found in 
Refs.~\cite{haydock72, kelly73, kelly74, kelly74b, burke76, haydock79, haydock82}.
In particular \cite{haydock79} presents a quantitative treatment of chemisorption of simple
molecules to transition metal surfaces across the transition metal series. 
\footnote{This study provides a strong positive example of analysis of homologous 
trends in materials according to Ehrenreich's fourth point Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}}.
A detailed discussion of surface catalysis is also given in Ref.~\cite{haydock80}
for the dissociation of hydrogen on a transition metal surface. The apparent
connection to embrittlement phenomenon will be discussed in detail in Chap.~\ref{chap:metallurgy}.

The Cambridge Recursion Library provides an example 
to demonstrate some of the technique required to perform 
calculations of electronic properties on a surface. 

The example treats the problem of the interaction of adatoms on a 
surface, i.e. adatoms interacting via the metallic substrate.
The formalism was partially developed in Ref.~\cite{einstein73} and 
allowed for the study of adatom interaction energy 
as a function of the substrate band filling, adatom energy level, and the hopping
potential chosen between the adatom and the substrate. The generalization
to multiple orbital adatoms was given in Ref.~\cite{burke76}. 

The problem reduces to finding the difference in the total energy of the system when
adatoms are distant (infinitely separated) and when they are close together.
The total energy of the system is written:
%
\begin{equation}
U_{\rm TOT} = \sum_{i}\epsilon_{i} - U_{\rm ES},
\end{equation}
%
the first term is the band structure contribution to the energy, integrated
across all the occupied electronic states (on an adatom), and the second term is the electrostatic
energy, including the interelectron repulsion (to avoid double counting), and the repulsion
between the ion cores. It is the first term that is considered to be of primary 
interest in the example and corresponds to the energetic contribution coming 
from the adatoms sharing electrons via the d-band substrate.

The calculation proceeds as follows. First the two atoms are placed at a sufficient
distance that they do not interact and the energy:
%
\begin{equation}
U_{1} = \int_{-\infty}^{E^{(1)}_{F}}EN_{1}(E)dE,
\end{equation}
%
is computed. 

Then the two adatoms are allowed to come together on the surface, 
a new density of states is recalculated along with the new Fermi level.
%
\begin{equation}
U_{2} = \int_{-\infty}^{E^{(2)}_{F}}EN_{2}(E)dE,
\end{equation}

The integrals of the two density of states up to the two Fermi energies are equal
(no electrons have been added to the system).

The interaction energy can now be written:
%
\begin{equation}
W = \int_{-\infty}^{E_{F}} (E-E_{F})(N_{2}-N_{1}) dE
\end{equation}
%

The two reference systems are labeled System 1 and System 2. In Fig.~\ref{fig:burkesurf}
System 1 consists of two substrates each with an adatom, System 2 is a substrate with
2 adatoms and the empty substrate giving a Hamiltonian $H_{2}+H_{0}$.

The density of states then become:
%
\begin{equation}
N_{1} = 2{\rm Tr}[EI-H_{1}]^{-1}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
N_{2} = {\rm Tr}[EI-H_{2}]^{-1}
\end{equation}

Finally the identity: 
%
\begin{equation}
{\rm Tr}[EI-H]^{-1} = \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \log \det[EI-H],
\end{equation}
%
is employed to reach an expression for the difference in the density
of states $\delta N=(N_{2}-N_{1})$.
%
\begin{equation}
\delta N = \frac{\partial}{\partial E}\log\frac{\det[EI-H_{2}]}{\det [EI-H_{1}]}\frac{[EI-H_{0}]}{[EI-H_{1}]}
\end{equation}
%

What then follows is some consideration of the block structure of the matrices 
$H_2$, $H_1$ and $H_0$. $H_2$ is a partitioned matrix of dimension 
$5N+6$ and $H_1$ has dimension $5N+3$. $H_{0}$ is the substrate Hamiltonian 
with dimensions $5\times N$ (orbitals times atoms).
The self energy elements are given in the block $E_A$, $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ describe
the atoms interactions with the substrate and the $V_{12}$ describe the interaction
between adatoms. Some identities from matrix algebra employed in Ref.~\cite{einstein73}
and given in the appendix of Ref.~\cite{burke76} are then used to simplify the
expressions to:
%
\begin{equation}
\delta N = \frac{\partial}{\partial E}\log \frac{\det G_{1}}{\det G_{2}}
\end{equation}
%

The physical meaning is that $\log \det G_{2}$ gives the energy required to pull
one of two adatoms away from the substrate and its paired atom, the $\log \det G_1$
term is the energy required to put it back on substrate at an isolated site. 
The difference between these two energies is then the interaction energy. 
Formulating the problem as a matrix means the determinant can be split 
into a sum over five separate logarithms. This is accomplished by ``orbital peeling".

\begin{equation}
{\rm det}|G_{2}| = \bar{G}_{21}\bar{G}_{22}\bar{G}_{23}\bar{G}_{24}\bar{G}_{25}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{\rm det}|G_{1}| = \bar{G}_{11}\bar{G}_{12}\bar{G}_{13}\bar{G}_{14}\bar{G}_{15}
\end{equation}

The matrix elements for each $G_{i\alpha}$ should be very familiar at this point:
%
\begin{equation}
G_{i\alpha}=\bra i,\alpha| [E-\bar{H}_{i\alpha}]^{-1} |i, \alpha\ket
\end{equation}
%
with $i=1,2$ $\alpha=1,5$. The matrix $\bar{H}_{i\alpha}$ is formed by taking 
$[E-\bar{H}_{i}]$, deleting the first $(\alpha-1)$ rows and columns 
to form $[EI-\bar{H}_{i\alpha}]$. The desired matrix element is now 
in the upper left-most corner of the matrix. 
Using this representation the difference in the density of states is calculated:
%
\begin{equation}
\Delta N = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{5} \frac{\partial}{\partial E}(\log\bar{G}_{1\alpha} - \log \bar{G}_{2\alpha})
\end{equation}
%

%
%The range of $E_{F}$ is restricted to $-0.068 \ge E_{F} \le 0.12$ Ryd by considerations
%based on the atomic configuration of tungsten as $5d^{4}6s^{2}$, meaning the band 
%should contain a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 electrons, with the band being half filled (5 e)
%considered the most plausible.

Fig.~\ref{fig:burkesurface} shows the energy difference as a function of the 
Fermi energy position. The energy is computed from the three p orbitals of a 
surface atom adhered to the same cluster studied in Sec.~\ref{sec:fccldos}.

%

These early surface calculations using the recursion method were overwhelmed 
by a number of uncertainties. The lack of a procedure for a choice of the tight-binding 
Hamiltonian and difficulties in accessing the self consistent charge density
and relaxed configurations in the presence of a surface being the most significant.
\footnote{For early work on Wannier functions at surfaces Ref.~\cite{smith74}. Also see 
\cite{mostoller79} for a treatment of surface effects using the recursion method.}

The development of first principles calculations 
has greatly simplified access to these quantities and should remove 
some of the ambiguities in mapping ab initio data onto a local picture
of the electronic structure at surfaces. These advances mean that the 
recursion techniques described in Refs.~\cite{burke76, haydock79, haydock81} 
might be revisited with potentially profitable effect. 

The interactions and forces of atoms adhered to surfaces are directly 
observable experimentally see Fink~\cite{fink84}.
For applications of orbital peeling to defects and the 
computation of interaction energies and variations in the charge density
see Refs.\cite{gibson93,gibson94}. However that work partially relies 
on the computation of off diagonal of the Green's function. A topic
to which we turn now.

\subsection{Off-Diagonal Elements of the Green's Function}
The off-diagonal elements of the Green's function can be written:
%
\begin{equation}
G_{AB}(E) = \bra \phi_{A}|[H-E]^{-1}|\phi_{B}\ket,
\end{equation}
%
and they contain a lot of useful information. 

These off-diagonal elements are required to calculate 
response functions, \cite{terakura78}, interatomic 
forces \cite{finnis84, finnis87, ohta87}, and bond orders 
\cite{coulson39,tersoff86,pettifor89}.

One direct route to computing an off-diagonal elements of the Green's function
is by expressing it as a linear combination of two diagonal elements. 
This can be seen by forming new starting vectors 
from the potential linear combinations of $\phi_{A}$ and $\phi_{B}$:
%
\begin{align}
\phi_{+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\phi_{A} + \phi_{B})\\
\phi_{-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\phi_{A} - \phi_{B})\\
\phi_{i+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\phi_{A} + i\phi_{B})\\
\phi_{i-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\phi_{A} - i\phi_{B}),
\end{align}
%
we can retrieve the off-diagonal elements by computing 
two `normal' diagonal elements from these linear combinations.
For example, for an Hermitian $\hat{H}$, and real $\phi_{A}$ and $\phi_{B}$ 
the $AB$ off-diagonal element of the Green's function can be computed as:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:offdiaggreen}
G_{AB}(E) = \frac{1}{2}[G_{++}(E)-G_{--}(E)].
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Tight Binding Bond Model}
\label{sec:tbbm}
To see how the off-diagonal elements contribute to the force on an 
atom we follow Sec. 2.4 of Sutton \cite{sutton88} and Ohta \cite{ohta87}.
First we reproduce their expression for the bond energy:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tbenergy}
u_{ij} = u^{\rm rep}_{ij} - \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{\lambda\mu} 
h_{ij}^{\lambda\mu}{\rm Im}\int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_{F}}G_{ji}^{\mu\lambda}(\epsilon+i0)d\epsilon,
\end{equation}
%
The total energy is then a sum over the bond energies:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tbtoten}
U^{\rm tot} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij,(i\neq=j)}u^{\rm tot}_{ij}
\end{equation}
%

The expression for the bond force follows naturally as the gradient of the bond energy:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tbforce}
f_{ij}^{\alpha} = f^{\rm rep}_{ij\alpha} - \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{\lambda\mu} 
\nabla_{i\alpha}h_{ij}^{\lambda\mu}{\rm Im}\int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_{F}}G_{ji}^{\mu\lambda}(\epsilon+i0)d\epsilon,
\end{equation}
%
$\alpha$ is a Cartesian direction, $i,j$ are site indices, and $\lambda, \mu$ are orbital indices 
the z axis lies along the bond connecting atoms i and j. 
We will return to the first term in Eq.~\ref{eq:tbforce} in Sec.~\ref{sec:harrisfoulkes} 
and Chapter~\ref{chap:wannier}. The computation of the derivative
of the Slater-Koster matrix elements, $\nabla h_{ij}^{\lambda\mu}$,
is discussed in Appendix~\ref{appen:grouptheory}.

For now it is the second term that is of interest and
it is easily recognized as something we can access via the Green's function 
computed using recursion techniques. It is also important to note that 
Eq.~\ref{eq:tbforce} is certainly not a two body interaction! The Green's function 
as it is calculated accounts for information from every shell of neighbours 
until there are no more or the recursion process is terminated. 
The importance of this local formulation of forces should not be underestimated.
Many of the practical applications discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:metallurgy} 
will rely on it.

%
These off-diagonal elements are also required to determine the vibrational properties. 
If we want the interatomic force constants determining the harmonic energy surface 
we follow Finnis\cite{finnis84} and go to second order in the variation of the 
total energy to derive the interatomic force constant matrix:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tbdynmat}
\psi_{\alpha\beta}^{ab} = \hat{\psi}_{\alpha\beta}^{ab} +  \sum_{dnq\sigma}(\delta 
\rho_{bd,a\alpha}^{nq,\sigma}\nabla_{\beta}h_{db}^{qn} + \delta\rho_{ad,b\beta}^{nq,\sigma}\nabla_{\alpha}h_{da}^{qn}),
\end{equation}
%
$h^{qn}_{db}$ is a two center hopping integral that links the orbital n on atom b to orbital 
q on atom d. For the d electrons this integral is taken to decay as
$\r^{5}$. The density changes are proportional to the variation in the Hamiltonian 
multiplied by the response function. Displacing atom a in the $\alpha$ direction induces a change in the
bond charges about atom b. The change in the bond charge between atoms b and d 
in the spin-$\sigma$ channel stemming from orbitals n and q is then given by:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tbdeltarho}
\delta \rho_{bd,a\alpha}^{nq,\sigma} = \sum_{cmp}(\chi_{bc,ad}^{np,mq,\sigma}+\chi_{ba,cd}^{nm,pq,\sigma})\nabla_{\alpha}h_{ac}^{pm}
\end{equation}
%
where the response function is defined as:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tbresponse}
\chi_{bc,ad}^{np,mq,\sigma} = \frac{1}{\pi}{\rm Im}\int^{E_{F}}G_{bc}^{np,\sigma}(\epsilon)G_{ad}^{mq,\sigma}(\epsilon)d\epsilon,
\end{equation}
%

An interesting relationship can be derived between off-diagonal elements
and the response functions \cite{terakura82, sutton88}:
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dG}{dE}=-G^{2},
\end{equation}
%
and upon integration:
%
\begin{equation}
G_{jk}(E^{+}) = -{\rm Im}\int^{E}\sum_{l}G_{jl}(E')G_{lk}(E')dE'.
\end{equation}
%

Fig.~\ref{fig:tbresponse} gives a pictorial representation of some of these many indiced terms. In 
Ref.\cite{finnis84} the Green's functions are computed out to sixth nearest neighbour. This allows
for force contributions out to the thirteenth nearest neighbour. Symmetry relations are exploited 
in that work to reduce the number of unique off-diagonal Green's function elements to 
33 separate functions which are tabulated and used to compute the force constant matrix. 
%
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}

\caption{Pictorial representation of the terms and sites 
described by Eq.~\ref{eq:tbdynmat}. On the left atoms $b,d$ 
and two orbitals centered on those sites, $n, q$, and the energy
integral $h_{bd}^{qn}$ which connects them. On the right are two unit cells
of BCC crystal with the nearest neighbours to the zeroth atom 
labeled out to its sixth nearest neighbour.\label{fig:tbresponse}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The type of analysis in Ref.~\cite{finnis84} is taken as an example
of the desired computational framework these notes pursue. 
The approach satisfies many of Ehrenreich's points ~\ref{en:ehrenreich}: 
direct experimental links, tractable calculations 
for a minimally idealized system, and, most importantly, 
the calculations have {\emph explanatory and predictive power 
across a homologous series}, in this case the BCC transition metals.
\footnote{For neutron spectroscopy data determining vibrational modes 
see \cite{powell68, colella70, shaw71}, The mystery of obtaining a 
good experimental phonon spectra in published literature continues... 
A. M. B. G. De Vallera, Ph.D. thesis, Cambridge University, 1977 (unpublished).
However it is apparently quite similar to NbMo\cite{powerll68}.}

The only point not fully satisfied is that of theoretical justification.
The force constants as determined in Eq.~\ref{eq:tbdynmat}
rely on the repulsive force and some means of determining 
the local Hamiltonian i.e. its bond integrals and their 
radial dependence {\it ab initio}. Addressing these issues
will be the subject of subsequent chapters. 
 
Eqs.~\ref{eq:tbdynmat, eq:tbdeltarho, eq:tbresponse} encode
a huge amount of information. Although well developed reciprocal space 
techniques exist, see Ref.~\cite{baroni01}, to obtain the phonon dispersion
curves, the local formulation still has a great deal of 
interprative value, and crucially, will remain valid
in situations where Bloch's theorem does not.

\section{The Bond Order}
\index{bond order}
The concept of a bond order has a long history.
It begins with Coulson's study of polyenes and aromatic 
molecules \cite{coulson39,coulson47}. Coulson's definition 
of the bond order begins from a molecular orbital picture. The molecular
orbital is a linear combination of atom centered orbitals $\psi_{n}$:
%
\begin{equation} 
\Psi = a_1\psi_1 + a_2\psi_{2} + ... +a_{n}\psi_{n},
\end{equation}
%
where $\sum_{n} a^{*}_{n}a_{n} = 1$, in Coulson's notation the bond order
then becomes:
%
\begin{equation}
\Theta_{ij}  = \frac{1}{2}[a_{i}a^{*}_{j} + a^{*}_{i}a_{j}].
\end{equation}
%
(where we have changed the notation of the bond order to the greek capital
theta rather than Coulson's preferred $p_{ij}$).
He goes on to examine the bond order in benzene, cyclobutadiene, 
and the alkyl chains C$_{\rm 2n}$H$_{\rm 2n+2}$ and alkyl radical chains 
$C_{2n+1}H_{2n+3}$ see Fig.~\ref{fig:coulsonmolecules}. 

The case of a hydrogen molecule $H_{2}$ is the simplest to 
visualize (panel Fig.~\ref{coulsonmolecules}). We build a wave function:
%
\begin{equation}
\Psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(\psi_{1} \pm \psi_{2})
\end{equation}
%
and the bond order is $\Theta_{ij} = \pm \frac{1}{2}$.

We may also consider $H_{2}^{+}$ and build a wave function:
%
\begin{equation}
\Theta_{ij} = \frac{\lambda\psi_{1} + \mu\psi_{2}}{(\lambda^{2} + \mu^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}},
\end{equation}
%
the bond order is maximized when $\lambda=\mu$, the two nuclei share the 
single electron equally. 

As a second example imagine a benzene molecule and we have a nearest neighbour 
hopping integral of $\beta$ (neglect any overlap of the orbitals).
We can build up the following molecular orbitals:
%
\begin{align}
\psi^{(1)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}[\psi_{1} +\psi_{2} +\psi_{3} + \psi_{4} + \psi_{5} + \psi_{6}],\quad \epsilon=-2\beta\\
\psi^{(2)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}[\psi_{1} + w\psi_{2} + w^2\psi_{3} + w^3\psi_{4} + w^4\psi_{5} + w^5\psi_{6}],\quad \epsilon=-\beta\\
\psi^{(3)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}[\psi_{1} + w^5\psi_{2} +w^4\psi_{3} + w^3\psi_{4} + w^2\psi_{5} + w\psi_{6}]\quad \epsilon=-\beta
\end{align}
%
the factor of $w=e^{\frac{i\pi}{3}}$, i.e. the roots of unity, ensures we have a normalized wavefunction. 
From the coefficient of the wavefunction the bond order can be computed directly and the total energy,
what Coulson calls the total ``mobile energy", but what would be called the band energy today is
given by:
%
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = -2\sum_{ij}\Theta_{ij}\beta_{ij}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{./invariance/coulsonbondorders.png}
\caption{An intuitive picture of the bond order can 
be grasped by considering some simple molecules: (a) H$_{2}$,
(b), cyclobutadiene, (c) benzene, and (d) alkyl radicals.
Coulson was able to make convincing quantitative 
arguments about the variation of the bond lengths and energetics
in these types of systems from the point of view of the bond order. 
\label{fig:coulsonmolecules}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Coulson's correlation of experimental data in the form of bond lengths
with the concept of the bond order in polyenes and aromatic molecules
is an elegant demonstration of a theory and application closely
linked to experimental data, and studying trends in a class of
homologous materials. A very deep understanding of the energetics of 
hydrocarbon chains is made.

The bond order quantifies the accumulation or depletion of charge between
atoms as the coefficients of the orbitals are tuned to minimize the total energy.
Coupled with Feynman's intuition of positive nuclei being attracted to regions
of accumulated negative charge we begin to understand how solids are held together\cite{feynman39}.
It is of further interest to note that Coulson's paper requires the calculation of 
the determinate for a tridiagonal Hamiltonian (see also Ref.~\cite{coulson38}). 
The mathematics involved will be familiar to those happy students 
who have studied the linear chain model.

\footnote{Altmann and Bowens biographical sketch of C.A.Coulson\cite{altmann74} 
is highly recommended reading. As a contemporary of Dirac at Cambridge
Coulson witnessed first hand the early developments of quantum theory.\index{Coulson, C.A.} 
He would go on to play an early role in the application of wave mechanics 
to the study of molecules and crystals. 
In fact, Coulson is supposed to have attended a seminar given by Dirac 
where Dirac was discussing the uncertainty relation: $xp-px=ih$.
When Coulson inquired when this work had been done Dirac replied, 
``Last night." In 1938 Coulson may have performed what was
the first iterative self-consistent field calculation
on a molecule, H$_2$, by hand (with the possible help of a 
Brunsviga calculator purchased for \pounds 25.)
~\cite{coulson38}. Coulson's life work spans diverse fields.
A small selection from his bibliography will find work 
touching on numerical methods \cite{coulson37,coulson42}, 
random walks with an application to a certain type of slug 
traversing a surface in the presence of a bright light \cite{coulson47}, 
the electronic structure of aromatic compounds and polymers, 
dielectric media, and theology. The application of the methods 
reviewed in the present work to his fields of endeavour would 
constitute a textbook onto itself.}

The order of a given bond is a measure
of the force tending to change the length of a given bond
for a small variation of the bond length.

Defined in terms of Green's functions, the bond order is the integrated 
energy difference between a symmetric and anti-symmetric combination 
of nearest neighbour orbitals \cite{pettifor89}:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bondorder}
\Theta_{ij} = - \frac{2}{\pi} {\rm Im} \int^{E_{F}}\left[G^{+}_{00}(E)-G_{00}^{-}(E)\right]dE.
\end{equation}
%
The bond order in this form then appears like a measure of the interference 
between orbitals on the two sites.

As we integrate up in energy the difference in the symmetric and antisymmetric 
combinations of the two states are accumulated. The resulting integral is 
then a scalar which measures the sign and magnitude of the
interference between the two localized orbitals up to the Fermi energy.

Eq.~\ref{eq:offdiaggreen} gives an immediate scheme for computing the 
off-diagonal elements but can result in the need for substracting 
two largish quantities to find a small one. Such a procedure 
is never ideal. This concern and others motivated the introduction
of the block recursion method which will be discussed shortly.

First though a small digression.

Harrison in his textbook argues that every conclusion drawn in 
his work follows immediately from the proposition that electrons 
are simultaneously a particle and a wave. 
In the context of the recursion method we can propose 
a tentative meaning to his statement: the electron is a 
particle when we can point to it and say, `There it is. 
It is in that orbital centered on that atom.' It becomes a wave 
when the recursion process is initiated and the spectral weight of the 
localized orbital spreads outwards onto neighbouring atoms. 
The form this interaction takes in the recursion method 
is the linear mixing of the starting vector
with the other localised vectors in the system from 
further and further away, adding these vectors with changing coefficients,
allowing them to interfere constructively or deconstructively. 

When the recurrence is terminated a record of the projection of 
the starting orbital on to each of its increasingly distant neighbours 
is recorded. The electron, though confined to a discrete energy 
and state on the lone atom, when placed in a solid, can 
take on a range of shapes across a range of energies distributed 
throughout a crystal.

\subsection{Non-Orthogonal Recursion}
\label{sec:tensornotation}
The underlying assumption about the basis vectors
used to describe the system up to this point have 
been that they are orthogonal. However the most intuitive basis set to 
choose, a basis of atomic orbitals centered on an atom, 
the original choice made by Bl\"och, will not be orthogonal. 

L\"owdin functions are a class of localized orthogonal functions,
as are Wannier functions but the price to be paid for
obtaining these functions is often that of an entire 
first principles calculation. These matters will 
be discussed further in Chap.~\ref{chap:wannier}.

Anderson's chemical pseudopotential theory is formulated 
in terms of a generalized eigenvalue problem \cite{anderson68,anderson69}
as are the molecular building block type orbitals of \cite{edmiston63} 
and the work of Boys and Boys and Foster~\cite{boys60a,boys60b}. 

Though we begin to digress it is clear that for physical 
and numerical accuracy we require an orthogonal basis 
set but for intuition or heuristic purposes we may wish to continue thinking
in terms of nicely formed localized starting states that 
are not orthogonal but easy to picture and initialize.

In any case when the basis vectors set up to describe the system
are not orthogonal some choices need to be made. There are two options.
The most tempting option is just to ignore the non-orthogonality of the
vectors and carry on. The other is to modify our approach somewhat. 
The latter course is the morally upright one. 

If the basis set for the Hamiltonian is given as a set of
${\phi_{m}}$ orbitals elements of the overlap matrix can 
be written:
%
\begin{equation}
[S]_{mn} = \int \phi^{*}_{m}(\r)\phi_{n}(\r)d\tau
\end{equation}
%

Given two states $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ which
are linear combinations of the $\phi$ the physical
overlap of the states is given: $\mathbf{v}^{\dagger}S\mathbf{u}$.

The Hamiltonian operator $\mathcal{H}$ acts on a basis orbital and
its effect is approximated by a sum over the basis orbitals:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}\phi_{n}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} H_{mn}\phi_{m}(\r)
\end{equation}

If the basis set is not orthogonal the Hamiltonian operator
is related to its representation in the basis set as:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_{mn} = [SH]_{mn}
\end{equation}

In the cases where S and $[\mathcal{H}_{mn}]$ are known the Hamiltonian
matrix is required which is obtained from:
%
\begin{equation}
H = S^{-1}[\mathcal{H}_{mn}],
\end{equation}
%
this transformed matrix is sometimes denoted $D$ in the literature
see Ref.~\cite{weeks73} for a discussion of the properties of
this transformed Hamiltonian. S should hopefully have some 
nice properties like its diagonal elements are unity and that it 
possesses small off-diagonal elements that fall off relatively 
quickly in real space.

The previous notation follows Haydock's article in Vol. 35 and uses 
a calligraphic $\mathcal{H}$ to denote the Hamiltonian operator and 
a roman $H$ with subscripts to denote the matrix elements of this operator 
projected onto the chosen basis set. 

In Ref.~\cite{ballentine86} Ballentine and Kol\'a\'r introduced 
a compact tensor notation to keep track of whether one was working 
with matrix elements of the overlap matrix and Hamiltonian 
in the non-orthogonal basis or in the Hamiltonian transformed by
the overlap matrix. The call to follow this tensor notation 
was echoed in Ref.~\cite{sutton88} and we describe it here to help
clarify the implementation of the non-orthogonal recursion method.
In Ref.~\cite{foulkes86} this notation was exploited in order to 
study some extensions of the recursion method to the evaluation of 
operator matrix elements. A transparent notation can greatly clarify
the concepts.

In what follows the lower case greek letters in the sub and superscripts
denote a composite orbital index comprised of the site-index and the 
angular momentum channel. In later sections of this chapter this notation
might be expanded with site indices denoted using lower case
roman letters and orbital indices denoted by lower case greek letters.
An effort is made to use $\alpha$ and $\beta$ where the index is a composite
one and $\lambda$, $\mu$, where they refer only to orbital indices with the 
site index made explicit. The usage should be clear from the context.

The matrix element of the overlap between non-orthogonal 
basis functions can be written:
%
\begin{equation}
S_{i\alpha j\beta} = \bra \psi_{i\alpha}|\psi_{j\beta}\ket
\end{equation}
%
with $i,j$ referring to a site index and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ 
referring to orbital indices.

The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian with the non-orthogonal states takes
the form:
%
\begin{equation}
H_{i\alpha j\beta} = \bra \psi_{i\alpha}|H|\psi_{j\beta}\ket
\end{equation}

The inverse of the overlap matrix is defined:
%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j\beta}(S^{-1})^{i\alpha j\beta}S_{j\beta l\gamma}=\delta^{i\alpha}\ _{l\gamma}.
\end{equation}
%

Naturally, the elements of the inverse overlap matrix $S^{-1}$ are chosen 
such that they produce the identity matrix upon multiplication $S$.

The dual set of basis vectors are then:
%
\begin{equation}
|\psi^{i\alpha}\ket = \sum_{j\beta}|\psi_{j\beta}\ket(S^{-1})^{j\beta i\alpha}.
\end{equation}
%
If the overlap matrix is just the identity matrix the original 
basis set is already orthonormal and the dual vectors (covariant
contravariant, or upper and lower indiced, depending
on your naming preference) are equal.

The two most important aspects of any basis set
are {\it representation} and {\it normalization}. 
We can {\it represent} an arbitrary physical 
vector $|u\ket$ as:
%
\begin{equation}
|u\ket = \sum_{i\alpha}u^{i\alpha}|\psi_{i\alpha}\ket = \sum_{i\alpha}u_{i\alpha}|\psi^{i\alpha}\ket.
\end{equation}
%
The expansion coefficients in either basis can be obtained via:
%
\begin{equation}
u_{i\alpha} = \sum_{j\beta}S_{i\alpha j\beta}u^{j\beta}.
\end{equation}
%

Along with {\it representation} we require a {\it norm} i.e. 
the inner product of two vectors:
%
\begin{equation}
\bra v|u \ket = \sum_{i\alpha i\beta}v^{i\alpha *}S_{i\alpha j\beta}u^{j\beta} = \sum_{i\alpha}v^{i\alpha *}u_{i\alpha} 
= \sum_{j\beta}v_{j\beta *}u^{j\beta}
\end{equation}
%

The Hamiltonian in a mixed representation takes the form:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mixedH}
H^{i\alpha}\ _{j\beta} = \sum_{\gamma}(S^{-1})^{i\alpha k\gamma}H_{k\gamma j\beta}.
\end{equation}
%
In the literature this form of the Hamiltonian matrix is sometimes referred to as $D$ 
not to be confused with $D$ as it applies to the force constant matrix in Ref.~\cite{weeks73}
and Sec.~\ref{sec:recphonon}.

The reason for going to all this trouble of defining upper and lower
indexed vectors and a tensor notation is illustrated by considering how the Schr\"odinger
equation looks in different representations. If one works with
the easily instantiated, in the sense that one has the Hamiltonian and
overlap matrix elements to hand, but non-orthogonal basis set, then the Schr\"odinger
equation takes the form:
%
\begin{equation}
H..\psi^{\mbox{\large .}}=\epsilon S..\psi^{\mbox{\large .}}
\end{equation}
%

However if the Hamiltonian is converted to the mixed representation:
%
\begin{equation}
H^{\mbox{\large .}}.\psi^{\mbox{\large .}}=\epsilon\psi^{\mbox{\large .}}
\end{equation}
%
the overlap matrix disappears and the eigenvalue problem is in a 
more familiar form. The Hamiltonian in the mixed representation 
is that obtained from Eq.~\ref{eq:mixedH}. The price is the Hamiltonian
is no longer necessarily Hermitian and the overlap matrix has to be inverted.

The starting vector for the recursion will often be a lower indiced
vector corresponding with the basis set chosen to represent the electron
states.

Ballentine and Koclar conclude by giving the trace of an operator
(roman site indices are suppressed):
\begin{align}
{\rm Tr}A =& \sum_{\alpha\beta}S_{\alpha\beta}A^{\beta\alpha}\\
          =& \sum_{\alpha\beta}(S^{-1})^{\alpha\beta}A_{\beta\alpha} \\
          =& \sum_{\alpha}A^{\alpha}\ _{\alpha}
\end{align}

The trace of the Hamiltonian or density operator would be necessary 
if one wished to compute, for example, the total band energy 
or the charge density. Computationally the way of proceeding will
depending on which matrix elements one has to hand, 
the lower indiced being the more accessible generally. 

As mentioned the trouble with the mixed representation of the Hamiltonian is,
although it escapes the need to deal directly with the overlap 
matrix or its inverse, it is no longer Hermitian. 

The following two subsections suggest a generalization of the recursion
scheme to deal with non-Hermitian matrices, and a practical means
of performing non-orthogonal calculations which exploit the Gauss-Seidel
iterative scheme to obtain the inverse of the overlap matrix.
In effect these two approaches amount to the choice of working
in the mixed representation or working with the inverse of the overlap
matrix and the lower indiced Hamiltonian respectively.

\subsubsection{Two-Sided Lanczos}
For the case where $H\neq H^{\dagger}$, i.e. for a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian, a two-sided Lanczos algorithm exists as discussed in
Ref.\cite{haydockkelly75} following Wilkinson's description.

Two starting vectors are chosen $|u_{0}\ket=|0\ket$, $|v_{0}\ket=|0\ket$
and two chains of recurrences are generated:
%
\begin{equation}
b_{n+1}|u_{n+1}\ket = H|u_{n}\ket - a_{n}|u_{n}\ket - b_{n}|u_{n-1}\ket
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
b_{n+1}|v_{n+1}\ket = H^{\dagger}|v_{n}\ket - a_{n}|v_{n}\ket - b_{n}|v_{n-1}\ket
\end{equation}
%
where $a_{n} = \bra v_{n}|H|u_{n}\ket = \bra u_{n}|H^{\dagger}|v_{n}\ket$
and the overlap is given by $b^{2}_{n+1} = \bra v_{n+1}|u_{n+1}\ket$.

The danger of the two sided recursion algorithm is that the inner
product of the vectors $\bra v_{n+1}|u_{n+1}\ket$ could become negative.
The density of states would no longer be non-negative which makes it
difficult to interpret. The fact that the Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian 
does not guarantee this will 
be the case so the application of this method may not produce 
any complex eigenvalues. 

S. F. Boys has given a thorough treatment
of the some of the properties of non-Hermitian operators in 
electronic structure calculations in Ref.~\cite{boys69}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{RECNO}: Recursion Non-Orthogonal Algorithm}
We now describe one approach to non-orthogonal basis 
vectors \index{non-orthogonal basis vectors} taken by
\texttt{CamRecLib} and the routine \texttt{recno}.
It is essentially the approach taken by Jones in Refs.\cite{jones84, jones85} which
uses the Gauss-Seidel method to compute the application 
of the inverse of the overlap matrix
and obtain the $H^{\alpha}_{\beta}$ of the Hamiltonian discussed in 
Section~\ref{sec:tensornotation}.

Following Nex in Ref.~\cite{nex89} the generalized 
eigenvalue problem to be solved becomes:

\begin{equation}
MX = ESX
\end{equation}

The Greenian computed is:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:greenianno}
\bra u_{0}S|[SE-M]^{-1}|Su_{0}\ket
\end{equation}
%

The \texttt{RECNO} algorithm then proceeds according to the following steps:
%
\begin{flalign}
\psi_{0} = & Su_{0} \\
b^{2}_{1} = & \bra u_{0}|\psi_{0} \ket \\
\end{flalign}

Then we recur updating the coefficients, $a_n$ and $b_n$, 
and the vector $u_n$:
%
\begin{flalign}
 a_{n} = \frac{\bra u_{n}|M|u_{n}\ket}{\bra u_{n}|\psi_{n} \ket}&\\
 b^{2}_{n+1} = \frac{\bra u_{n+1}|\psi_{n+1}\ket}{\bra u_{n}| \psi_{n}\ket}&\\
 \psi_{n+1} = M u_{n} - a_{n}\psi_{n} - b^{2}_{n}\psi_{n-1}&\\
 u_{n+1} = S^{-1}\psi_{n+1}&
\end{flalign}
%
The Gauss-Seidel Algorithm \index{Gauss-Seidel} is used 
in the final step to compute the application of the inverse 
of the overlap matrix to the recursion vector. 

The matrix vector product is computed by repeated application
(indexed by iteration number $i$) of the strict left and 
strict right triangular parts of $S$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gaussseidel}
u_{n+1}^{i} = \psi_{n+1} - Lu_{n+1}^{i} - Ru^{i-1}_{n+1}.
\end{equation}
%
Eq.~\ref{eq:gaussseidel} involves tracking the convergence with respect
to the number of iterations of Gauss-Seidel steps. The more strongly
diagonally dominant the matrix is the quicker it will converge.

In Ref.~\cite{weaire85} Jones proposes an alternative strategy
for obtaining and applying the inverse matrix $S^{-1}$ based on the Cholesky
decomposition \index{Cholesky Decomposition}.

A lower triangular matrix $L_{ij}$ is calculated by solving:
%
\begin{align}
\label{alg:cholesky}
L_{ll} = & \sqrt{S_{ll}}   &\\
S_{il} = & L_{il}L_{ll}    & i>l\\
S_{ij} = & \sum_{k \leq j}L_{ik}L_{jk} & j\leq i
\end{align}

$u_{n}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:gaussseidel} is then found by solving for $q$:
%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k\leq i} L_{ik}q_{k} = \psi_{i}
\end{equation}
%

followed by solving for $u$:
%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k\leq i} L_{ik}u_{k} = q_{i}
\end{equation}
%
using back substitution. 

For ease of reference we also write out the explicit expressions 
for the elements of $L$ determined in the Cholesky decomposition:
%
\begin{align}
L_{jj} =& \sqrt{S_{jj} - \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}L_{jk}L^{*}_{jk}}\\
L_{ij} =& \frac{1}{L_{jj}}(S_{ij}-\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}L_{ik}L^{*}_{jk})
\end{align}
%
The forward substitution can proceed column wise or row wise. 
See Ref.~\cite{wilkinson68} for a discussion of the stability 
of this procedure.

Both the Gauss-Seidel and Cholesky processes emphasise the physical consequence
of applying $S^{-1}$ to the recursion vector at each step.
It is like a small orthogonalizing hair-cut applied at each stage of the recurrence
to remove the double counting of components that would arise 
as a consequence of the overlap of the basis set. 

\subsection{\texttt{BLKRECLIB}: Block Recursion}
The block recursion method is a direct and intuitive extension of the scalar method.
In this method a {\emph set of m} initial orbitals are chosen. The recursion
coefficients then become matrices, and the continued fractions become
matrix continued fractions. The technique and its implementations are described 
in Refs.~\cite{jones84, legrand85, inoue87, nex89, godin91}. 
The applications of the block recursion method are varied.
Lewis and Jones in Ref.~\cite{jones84} derived the block recursion method
in order to compute the real space electron density from a basis of atomic orbitals.
Paxton's study of the stability of different phases of silicon in 
Refs.~\cite{paxton87, paxton88} required the block recursion method so that
the computed Greenians respected the underlying rotational symmetries of the 
Hamiltonian. This point will be discussed more shortly. The work of 
Godin and Haydock focused on the ability of the block recursion technique
to directly provide off diagonal Greenians required for quantum transmittance problems
on the passage of electrons through disordered media in Refs.~\cite{godin86, godin88}. 

The notation we supply here is a synthesis of the descriptions 
given in Refs.~\cite{paxton88, nex89} and is in 
accord with the accompanying \texttt{CamRecLib} routines.

We make a simple adjustment to the notation when discussing
block recursion as opposed to scalar recursion.
The starting vector $u_{0}$ and the recursion coefficients
$a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ from the scalar case are transformed to
matrices denoted by capital letters $U_{0}$, $A_{n}$, and $B_{n}$
in the case of block recursion. Where recursion coefficents could be
inverted by scalar division the block matrices require matrix inversion.

\subsubsection{Transforming Like a Tensor}
By picking a single orbital and turning the wheel on the recursion method a
chain of coefficients and vectors can be generated. However rounding errors in the evaluation
of the matrix vector products mean the accumulation of numerical noise
generated by the artifical truncation of the recurrence
can disrupt underlying symmetries. This can be demonstrated where there are 
deviations in the density of states computed for a given orbital if the z-axis 
is changed. For some historical insight into the need for block recursion formulation
we quote from Finnis' article in Ref.~\cite{andersen89}:

\begin{quote}
The first problem came to our attention in the course of 
calculating the relaxed structure of a (310) grain boundary.
The potential had been adjusted to ensure that the perfect lattice
was in equilibrium at zero pressure with the observed lattice constant. Yet
when the perfect lattice was reoriented to set up the (310) grain boundary, the 
perfect part of the structure was no longer in equilibrium! Our forces were not transforming
properly as vectors under rotations. In fact, neither was the energy rotationally invariant.
The cause of the problem was that although the exact Green function would transform as a tensor,
the approximate Green's function matrix elements obtained by termination or quadrature
methods do not transform exactly into their symmetry related combinations under lattice 
rotations.
\end{quote}

Inoue and Ohta addressed the former problem, i.e. the proper transformation of the forces,
in their formulation of the block recursion method\cite{inoue87}. 
It is useful to incorporate their discussion of the underlying 
symmetries of the Green's function and Greenians.

Their notation follows Edminson where a rotation of the co-ordinate axis
of the system by the Euler angles $\alpha$,$\beta$, and $\gamma$ is denoted:

\begin{equation}
R(\alpha\beta\gamma)H
\end{equation}

The action of an element of the symmetry group of the crystal can be computed:
%
\begin{equation}
\Rs(\alpha\beta\gamma)H =  D_{mm'}^{\dagger}(\Rs)HD_{mm'}(\Rs)
\end{equation}
%
where $D(\Rs)$ is a matrix representation of the symmetry operation
$\Rs$ written in the basis of the spherical harmonics. 

If the crystal under considerations has a potential 
$V$ which transforms as some symmetry group
the Slater-Koster matrix elements will also transform 
according to that symmetry group:
%
\begin{equation}
H_{i\lambda j\mu} = \bra \phi_{i\lambda} | -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2} + V|\psi_{j\mu} \ket
\end{equation}
%

One of the motivations for the block recursion algorithm 
is the symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian is preserved 
by construction in the coefficient blocks $A_{n}$ 
and $B_{n}$\cite{inoue87}. A discussion of the
transformation of spherical harmonics for different crystal symmetries
is included in the appendix \ref{appen:grouptheory}.

\subsection{The Block Recursion Algorithm}
\label{sec:blockrecursion}
\index{blockrecursion}
The matrix Greenian to be computed is:
\begin{equation}
G(E) = \bra U_{0}S|[SE-H]^{-1}|SU_{0}\ket
\end{equation}

The starting vector $u_{0}$, which in the scalar recursion
was a starting orbital or a linear combination of 
starting orbitals represented as a vector, 
is now a matrix (or block) of starting orbitals. 
The initial block matrix can be written:
%
\begin{equation}
(U^{s}_{0})_{\lambda\mu} = \delta_{is}\delta_{\lambda\mu} \pm \delta_{js}\delta_{\lambda\mu}
\end{equation}
%
with $s,i,j$ running over the site indices and 
U is an $N\times p$ block of orbitals
with N the number of sites and p the 
number of orbitals.

Nex formulates the block recursion in terms of the 
$D$ matrix, or in the tensor notation, the 
Hamiltonian in the mixed representation 
(Sec.~\ref{sec:tensornotation}):
%
\begin{equation}
D = S^{-1}H = H^{i\alpha}\ _{j\beta}.
\end{equation}
%

The steps of the block Lanczos iteration then follow a familiar pattern.
The projection of the current step is computed:
%
\begin{equation}
A_{n} = \bra U_{n}|SD|U_{n}\ket,
\end{equation}
%
and the next block of vectors in the chain is formed 
by application of the Hamiltonian and orthogonalization
to the previous block:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:blockrec}
U_{n+1}B^{\dagger}_{n+1} = V_{n+1} = DU_{n} - U_{n}A_{n} - U_{n-1}B_{n}.
\end{equation}
%
The vector $V_{n+1}$, which is produced operationally by the right hand
side of Eq.~\ref{eq:blockrec}, needs to be factored into the blocks
$U_{n+1}$ and $B_{n+1}$. 

The factorization is carried out be performing a modified Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization on  $U_{n+1}B_{n+1}^{\dagger}$. The $B$ matrices are
lower triangular and are the Choleski factors of $B^{\dagger}B$
see Refs.~\cite{nex89,godin91}.

$B_{n}$ and $A_{n}$ are $NP\times NP$ 
matrices with $NP$ the number of columns in the initial block matrix, 
or, physically, the number of starting orbitals chosen to
initiate the recursion. A common choice for the starting block
might be the full set of atomic orbitals centered on a particular 
site: e.g. all 5 d-orbitals centered on an atom in an FCC crystal. Another
choice would be two blocks of orbitals on separate atoms to compute
off-diagonal blocks analogous to the off-diagonal scalar elements.
Each step of the block recursion then propagates an entire 
subspace of the matrix rather than just a single element.

There are a few different ways to factor $V_{n+1}$. Nex
uses a modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm to orthogonalise 
with respect to S directly. Denoting the columns of V and U
as $v_{i}$ and $u_{i}$, the Gram-Schmidt process takes the
form:
%
\begin{equation}
u_{i} = \frac{1}{k_{i}}[v_{i} - \sum_{j < i}(v^{\dagger}_{i}Su_{j})u_{j}]
\end{equation}
%
This can be rearranged with $B_{n}$ a lower triangular 
matrix (note it is $B^{\dagger}$ that is applied 
in Eq.~\ref{eq:blockrec}):
%
\begin{equation}
b_{ij} = k_{ij}\delta_{ij} + \bra v_{i}|Su_{j}\ket (1-\delta_{ij}) \quad j>i
\end{equation}

The effect of the three term block recurrence procedure
is demonstrated by the action of the D matrix on the 
chain:
%
\begin{align*}
D\left[U_{0}U_{1}U_{2}...\right] = [U_{0}U_{1}U_{2}...] 
                  \begin{bmatrix}       A_{0}           & B_{1}  & 0                &   0    & ...  \\
                                        B_{1}^{\dagger} & A_{1}  & B_{2}            &   0    & ...  \\
                                        0               & B_{2}  & A_{2}            & B_{3}  & ...  \\
                                        \vdots          & \vdots & B^{\dagger}_{3}  & \ddots & ...  \\
                  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
%

\subsubsection{Matrix Continued Fractions}
The matrix recursion coefficients $A_{n}$ and $B_{n}$ are handled by
analogy with their scalar counterparts $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$. 
In general the recursion library provides two 
different approaches to generating 
the desired resolvent spectra from the 
recurrence coefficients or blocks of coefficients:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item A quadrature approach
\item A termination approach
\end{enumerate}
%

Most of the discussion 
of the handling of the continued fractions in the scalar case
is deferred to the mathematical appendix and it is recommended 
the reader familiarizes themselves with that. The equations for
generating the resolvents from the block 
recursion coefficient matrices are 
included here for ease of reference.

The identities for the convergents of a scalar continued fraction (see Appendix)
are generalized to matrices. There are two types.

Type 1:
\begin{equation}
B_{n+1}P_{n+1}(E) = (E-A_{n})P_{n}(E) -B^{\dagger}_{n}P_{n-1}(E),
\end{equation}
%
with $P_{-1}(E)=0$ and $P_{0}(E)=B_{0}^{-1}$,
and type 2:
%
\begin{equation}
B_{n+1}Q_{n}(E) = (E-A_{n})Q_{n-1} -B_{n}Q_{n-2}(E),
\end{equation}
%
with $Q_{-1}(E)=0$ and $Q_{0}(E)=B_{1}^{-1}B^{\dagger}_{0}$.
%
Defining the terminal matrix polynomials as:
\begin{equation}
P_{L}(E) = P_{L}(E) -T(E)B_{L}^{\dagger}P_{L-1}(E)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
Q_{L}(E)=[Q_{L-1}(E) -T(E)B_{L}^{\dagger}Q_{L-2}(E)]
\end{equation}

The Greens function matrix can be written:
%
\begin{equation}
G(E) = P_{L}^{-1}(E)Q_{L}(E)
\end{equation}
%
The simplest choice of matrix terminator,$T(E)$, 
is a diagonal matrix with the corresponding 
terminators for the scalar case along the diagonals.

\subsection{Phonon Recursion}
\label{sec:recphonon}
With a simple modification phonon spectra can be computed directly 
using the recursion technique. Instead of localized orbitals, localized 
displacements are introduced, and in the place of on-site and hopping
matrix elements force constants connecting a finite set of nearest neighbours.
The rest proceeds along identical lines to the electronic case.

The papers and PHD thesis of Meek describe in detail the 
early application of the recursion method to the computation of 
vibrational spectra \cite{meek76, meek78}. 
The method is particularly useful for
computing vibrational spectra in disordered media 
where a statistical averaging procedure needs to be 
undertaken \cite{mookerjee04}.

In the Harmonic approximation the force constant matrix of a crystal can be written as:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:forceconstant}
\Phi_{\alpha\alpha'}(l\kappa,l\kappa') = \frac{\partial^{2}V}{\partial u_{\alpha}(l\kappa) \partial u_{\alpha'}(l'\kappa')}
\end{equation}
%

The equation of motion for atom $i$ becomes:
%
\begin{equation}
m_{k} \frac{\partial^{2} u_\alpha (l\kappa)}{\partial t^{2}} = - \sum_{l'\kappa'\alpha'}
\Phi_{\alpha\alpha'}(l\kappa,l'\kappa')u_{\alpha'}(l'\kappa'),
\end{equation}
%
l, $\kappa$, and $\alpha$, represent the unit cell index, basis atom, and 
cartesian coordinate of the displacement respectively.

A solution of the form:
%
\begin{equation}
u_{\alpha}(lk) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m_{k}}} U_{\alpha}(\kappa;\k)e^{[i(\k\cdot x(l) - \omega_{\k}t)]},
\end{equation}
%
is assumed where $U_{\alpha}(\kappa;\k)$ is the amplitude of the displacement.
%
\begin{equation}
\omega^{2}(\k) U_{\alpha}(\kappa, \k) = \sum_{\kappa'\alpha'}D_{\alpha\alpha'}(\kappa\kappa';\k) U_{\alpha'}(\kappa',\k)
\end{equation}
%
and the Fourier transform of the dynamical matrix has been introduced:

\begin{equation}
D_{\alpha\alpha'}(\kappa\kappa';\k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m_{k}m_{k'}}} \sum_{l'} \Phi_{\alpha\alpha'}(l\kappa,l'\kappa') e^{[i\k(x(l')-x(l))]}
\end{equation}
%
The vibrational frequencies of the normal modes of a cluster or crystal can then be determined 
from the secular equation:
%
\begin{equation}
{\rm det}|D(\k) - \omega^{2}(\k)I| = 0
\end{equation}
%

The Green's function matrix elements for the vibrational problem 
becomes the projection of the interaction matrix on to the 
displacement of atom $i$ in direction $\alpha$.
%
\begin{equation}
G_{i\alpha,i\alpha}(\omega^{2})= \bra i\alpha| \left[D- \omega^{2}I\right]^{-1} |i\alpha \ket
\end{equation}
%

The use of translational symmetry of a crystal
can be readily appreciated. By applying translational
symmetry to a 2 atom unit cell of a perfect 
crystal Eq.~\ref{eq:phonon} would only
need to be computed for a 6x6 matrix at every $\k$ point 
in the Brillouin zone to determine the vibrational frequencies. 

In this case there would be little need for employing a recursion method.
Well developed techniques exist to obtain the force constant 
matrix at every $\k$ point from first principles \cite{baroni01}.
However these techniques require assumptions about
microscopic periodicity which are frequently  
not valid. 

For any amount of disorder at the atomic level, for instance in the systems 
studied by Meeks secular determinants of $3N\times3N$ with
$N=200-300$ may need to be solved. In these situations recursion 
type calculation become preferable. \cite{dean92}
%
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
{\graphicspath{{./invariance/rec_examples/phonon/}}\input{./invariance/rec_examples/phonon/phonon_dos.tex}}
\caption{The local phonon density of states for a small six atom molecule 
composed of two atom types. The model is specified by giving the 
masses of the two atoms. In the present simulation 
the masses are chosen to be 0.25 and $0.189$ amu. Two force constants are also
specified, a bond stretching force constant of 1.0, 
which is the same for both atomic types
and two bond bending force constants of 0.5 and 0.25 \label{fig:phonondos}. 
The phonon DOS relies on the routine
\texttt{RECSUM} to combine the continued fraction coefficients 
for the vibration modes computed for each site. 
The six atom system has $3N-6=12$ vibration modes and the 
DOVS integrates to 12 as expected.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
The phonon density of states and the integrated phonon density of 
states is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:phonondos} 
for a six atom molecule consisting of two atomic types. The number of 
sets of continued fraction coefficients
that needs to be generated is equal to $3*N_{s}$ where $N_{s}$ 
is the number of atoms that the phonon LDOS
or density of vibrational states (DOVS), is computed 
for and the factor of 3 is for the displacement in each 
atomic direction. The expression for the average phonon density of states
over the different matrix elements of the resolvent 
is first over the cartesian displacements $\alpha$:
%
\begin{equation}
n_{i}(\omega^{2}) = \sum_{\alpha}n_{\alpha,i}(\omega^{2}),
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
N(\omega) = \frac{2\omega}{N_{s}}\sum_{i}^{N_{s}}n_{i}(\omega^{2}),
\end{equation}
%
its integral gives the total number of vibrational modes.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:phonondos} two sites are used to generate the 
DOVS, to a depth of $7$ in the continued fraction coefficients. 
The postprocessing of the continued fraction coefficients 
is the same as in the case of the surface and bulk DOS calculations. 
In Meeks work sufficient feature resolution in the DOVS is 
achieved with a depth of 20 in the recursion steps for a 
cluster of 344 diamond atoms. The force constants entering 
these models were not ab initio instead being 
derived from a model due to Born \cite{born14}. 
It is now possible to obtain highly accurate force 
constants from first principles. The higher 
quality force constant matrices that can be generated 
as a result could well be reflected in the quality 
(with respect to experiment) of the features 
observed in the density of states.

Direct examination of the routines involved in the

for how the recursion method works. In Table~\ref{tab:phonon} 
the various routines and the task they accomplish are listed. 
These routines specify the entire problem and with minor 
adaptations, (the crystal structure, force constants etc.), can 
be used to compute the DOVS for any system.

\section{Recursive Perturbation Theory:\texttt{RECPER}}
A measurement of a material property takes the form of some kind of probe. 
The probe may be a photon or an electron that is launched in the direction of a sample. 
The scattering of the probe by the material is observed and inferences about the material
property are drawn. In other experiments a material is stretched or 
twisted and the reaction of the material is recorded.
Again, based on the observed reactions
we can make inferences about the microscopic properties of the material.
For engineering purposes we would like to invert this procedure and deduce
macroscopic material properties for a given microscopic configuration of atoms.

In any case we would like a method for calculating the response of our material system
to a probe. Perturbation theory is ideally suited for this. Switching to the language of quantum
mechanics we would like to calculate the expectation values associated with the operator 
which describes a probe. Since we are primarily interested in recursion theory we would like
our perturbation theory to resemble what we have discussed so far. We want to work with a tri-diagonalized
matrix and continued fractions. Haydock has derived the necessary results.
The algebra of recursive perturbation theory has been worked out
in Ref.\cite{haydock77} and, of course, Vol.~35\ref{vol35} (pg.~281). Applications
of perturbation theory to calculating operator expectations values has been made in Ref.~\cite{mclean77,foulkes86}.
Perhaps the most significant application of the perturbation theory, in the form described in this section,
has been to Haydock's study of the electronic properties of disordered materials and 
the phenomenon of Anderson localization (see Sutton \cite{sutton} for a description of this phenomenon),
see Refs.~\cite{haydock78,haydock81b,haydock81c,haydock86}.

In this section we will mention just enough about perturbation theory and the recursion method so that
the reader can use the \texttt{RECPER} routine with some confidence for performing calculations. 

The Green's function we are looking to obtain is:
%
\begin{equation}
G(E) = \left[E - \hat{H} - \lambda \hat{F}\right]^{-1},
\end{equation}
%
where $\hat{F}$ is a local representation of the perturbation multiplied by some scalar $\lambda$
that determines the strength of the perturbation. 

We have already seen how to compute off-diagonal elements of the Green's function in Sec.~\ref{sec:tbbm} and
we shall return to this in Chapter~\ref{chap:metallurgy} when we look more closely at vibrational
and elastic properties of metals. That approach involves the calculation of a large number of these off-diagonal
elements. Sometimes, as we shall see, this is desirable because it allows us to directly `observe' which electronic
mechanisms are responsible for certain vibrational or elastic responses. However if we are only interested in expectation
values Haydock's method is the more efficient, as we shall now see.

The full derivation of the perturbation method has been given
in Vol.~35 and Ref.~\cite{haydock77} and there is little need to reproduce
the details here. What is worth including is the discussion of the calculation of matrix elements in the 
recursion method. This is accomplished using the perturbation theory and is part of any well rounded recursors toolkit.
The formalism appeared a few years after Vol.~35 and is due to Foulkes and Haydock \cite{foulkes86} so it 
is worthwhile folding it in to the present discussion in the spirit of collecting all things recursion related into one place.

The expectation value of our perturbing operator can be written:
%
\begin{equation}
\bra \hat{F}_{i} \ket = \sum_{\epsilon}\bra\psi_{i}|\hat{F}|\psi_{i}\ket,
\end{equation}
%
we can rewrite this as a contour integral:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:contourpert}
        \bra \hat{F}_{i} \ket = \int_{C_{f}} {\rm Tr} \{ \hat{F}^{i}\ _{j} \underbrace{\left[E-\hat{H}\right]^{-1j}\ _{i}}_{G^{j}\ _{i}(E)} \} \frac{dE}{2\pi i}.
\end{equation}
%
We have written the matrix elements in the mixed representation (cf. Sec.~\ref{sec:tensornotation}) so
the results are appropriate for a non-orthogonal basis. Eq.~\ref{eq:contourpert} involves the calculation
of a large number of off-diagonal Greenian elements which we may want to avoid.

To do this we use the following relationship:
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{d\lambda} [E-\hat{H}-\lambda \hat{F}]^{-1} \Bigr|_{\lambda = 0} = [E-\hat{H}]^{-1}\hat{F}[E-\hat{H}]^{-1}
\end{equation}
%

Using this relationship we can rewrite Eq.~\ref{eq:contourpert} as:
%
\begin{equation}
        \bra \hat{F} \ket = \int E \frac{d}{d\lambda} {\rm Tr}\underbrace{[E-\hat{H}-\lambda \hat{F}]^{-1}}_{\tilde{G}(E)} \frac{dE}{2\pi i},
\end{equation}
%
where we have identified $\tilde{G}(E)$ as the new perturbed Greenian that we require. 

The definition chosen for the new recurrence is quite natural:
%
\begin{equation}
        [\hat{H} + \lambda \hat{F}] u_{0}(\lambda) = a_{0}(\lambda)u_0(\lambda=0) + b_1(\lambda)u_{1}(\lambda),
\end{equation}
%
we could included higher order corrections but first order is all that is required for the expectation values.

The convergents of the continued fraction are then generated recursively from the relations
$P_{-1}=Q_{0}=0$ and $P_{0}=Q_{1}=1$:
\begin{align}
b_{n+1}P_{n+1} = (E-a_{n})P_{n} - b_{n}P_{n-1}\\
b_{n+1}Q_{n+1} = (E-a_{n})Q_{n} - b_{n}Q_{n-1}
\end{align}

The perturbed convergents also take a simple form:
%
\begin{align}
P_{n}(E,\lambda) = P^{(0)}_{n}(E) + \lambda P_{n}^{(1)}(E) + \lambda^{2}P_{n}^{(2)}(E) + \cdots \\
Q_{n}(E,\lambda) = Q^{(0)}_{n}(E) + \lambda Q_{n}^{(1)}(E) + \lambda^{2}Q_{n}^{(2)}(E) + \cdots 
\end{align}
%

The expectation value is calculated from the perturbed and unperturbed convergents as:
%
\begin{equation}
        \bra \hat{F} \ket = - \int_{C_{f}} \frac{P_{N+1}^{(1)}}{P_{N+1}^{(0)}} \frac{dE}{2\pi i}
\end{equation}

The denominator has poles at the eigenvalues of the unperturbed system so the contour integral can be evaluated
as a sum over the residue at these poles:
%
\begin{equation}
        \bra \hat{F} \ket = - \sum_{\epsilon_{i} < \epsilon_{f}} \frac{P^{(1)}_{N+1}(\epsilon_{i})}{P'^{(0)}_{N+1}(\epsilon_{i}}
\end{equation}

To avoid the need for recursing until the chain states have covered the entire matrix
an approximate matrix element is calculated. The approximation is that after a certain number
of steps the localized perturbation will die out leaving only the unperturbed chain. We
write the approximate matrix element as:
%
\begin{equation}
\bra \tilde{F} \ket = -\int \frac{\tilde{P}_{N=1}(E)}{P_{N+1}^{(0)}} \frac{dE}{2\pi i}
\end{equation}
%

The $\tilde{P}(E)$ can be generated as follows. Say we have computed $N+1$ iterations of the recursion method.
Choose $n$ smaller than $N+1$ and compute the coefficients, $a_{0},b_{0},...,a(\lambda)_{n},b(\lambda)_{n}$
up to whatever order of $\lambda$ is desired. We will state
the expressions for these shortly. For the remaining terms,$n+1...N+1$, 
the coefficients and terminator are to be generated from the unperturbed chain.

After some considerable algebraic flourishes, the details best left to the experts, see Haydock Vol. 35 pg. 281 and 
subsequent, we can write the expectation value in terms of the perturbed and unperturbed convergents and the unperturbed
density of states:
%
\begin{equation}
\bra \hat{F} \ket = \int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_{f}}b_{n+1,0}\left[P_{n+1}^{(0)}\tilde{P}_{n}^{(1)}(E) - P_{n}^{(0)}\tilde{P}_{n+1}^{(1)}(E) \right]n_{0}(E)dE
\end{equation}
%

All that remains is to see the expressions required for computing our perturbed chain states and coefficients.
To conclude this section we detail these steps.
The subroutine for computing these quantities is \texttt{RECPER}.

The quantities of interest are: 
$u_{n}(\lambda)=\sum_{m}u_{n}^{(m)}\lambda^{m}$, 
$a_{n}(\lambda)=\sum_{m}a_{n}^{(m)}\lambda^{m}$, and 
$b_{n}(\lambda)=\sum_{m}b_{n}^{(m)}\lambda^{m}$. 

The method is derived by applying the Hamiltonian and the perturbation to the chain state expanded in $\lambda$
and then taking care to collect terms to the same order in $\lambda$ together for the next iteration.

\begin{align}
        a_{n}^{(l)} = \sum_{m=0}^{l} u_{n}^{(m)\dagger } S\hat{H} u_{n}^{(l-m)} + \sum_{m=0}^{l-1} u_{n}^{(m)\dagger}S\hat{F} u_{n}^{(l-m)} \\
        x_{n}^{(l)} = \hat{H} u_{n}^{(l)} + \hat{F} u_{n}^{(l-1)} - \sum_{m=0}^{l}\left[ a_{n}^{(m)}u_{n}^{l-m} + b_{n}^{(m)}u_{n-1}^{(l-m)} \right] \\
        b_{n+1}^{(l)} = \left[ \sum_{m=0}^{l} x^{(m)\dagger }_{n}S x^{l-m}_{n} - \sum_{m=1}^{l-1} b_{n+1}^{(m)} b_{n+1}^{(l-m)} \right]\frac{1}{2b_{n+1}^{(0)}} \\
        u_{n+1}^{(l)} = \left[ x_{n}^{(l)} - \sum_{m=0}^{l-1} b^{(l-m)}_{n+1} u^{(m)}_{n+1} \right] \frac{1}{b_{n+1}^{(0)}} 
\end{align}

where the intermediate vector $x_{n}{^(l)}$ has been introduced to simplify the expressions

\section{Chains and Moments}
Before concluding this chapter we may make a few 
comments on the relation of the recursion techniques 
to other methods.

The recursion method is a numerically stable way of obtaining information 
about the distribution of eigenvalues associated with a given Hamiltonian. 
The explicit formulation of the results as a continued fraction 
gives us access to accurate integrals over the spectrum. 

Furthermore, the mathematics of the technique are uniquely consistent
with the physical idea of an electron exploring
the space around it as it diffuses according to Schr\"odinger's
equation. This diffusion process is guided by the interactions present in the Hamiltonian.
In practice we initiate these excursions from some prepared localized starting state, e.g. 
we put the electron in an orbital localized on a particular atom,
and as the electron (or phonon, or magnon, etc...) hops from atom to atom
the spectral properties of the system come into sharper and sharper relief.

The closest relation to the recursion method is the method of moments
\cite{cyrotlackmann67, ducastelle70,ducastelle71}. Cyrot-Lackmann first applied
moments based methods to obtain some estimates of the electronic density of
states in liquid metals\cite{cyrotlackmann67}. This work was then extended
to incorporate d electrons and investigate cohesive energies and stacking
fault energies in crystalline structures. David Pettifor placed the moment's 
theorem as a central section of his textbook\cite{pettifor94} under the heading
``The Origin of Structural Trends: A Moments Theorem" which gives some indication
of the importance he accorded these ideas.

The method can be directly obtained by expanding the 
Green's function as a geometric series in the energy and the Hamiltonian:
%
\begin{equation}
[E-H]^{-1} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{H^{n}}{E^{n+1}}.
\end{equation}
%

The $r^{\rm th}$ moment of the local density of states can be written:
%
\begin{equation}
\mu^{r} = \int E^{r}N(E)dE = -\frac{1}{\pi}{\rm Im}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\int E^{r}\bra 0|\frac{H^{n}}{E^{n+1}}|0\ket dE.
\end{equation}
%

The comparison is valuable because it leads to the interpretation of 
the recursion method as producing a density of states by closed walks
from a starting point\cite{ducastelle70}. Formulating problems
which arise in condensed matter physics in terms of the moments of
an operator also build a bridge to analytical tools mathematicians
have developed in the field of moments. The mathematical techniques
and the surprisingly deep connections between moments, orthogonal
polynomials, and continued fractions are explored in Appendix~\ref{appen:app2}.

When $H$ is a strictly local Hamiltonian the only non-zero matrix elements 
will be immediate neighbours of the starting orbital $0$. The means
the matrix element can be written as a over closed paths of length $r$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:circuit}
\bra 0|H^{n}|0 \ket = \sum_{i,j,k,...}\bra 0|H|i\ket\bra i|H|j\ket\bra j|H|...\ket\bra 1|H|0\ket,
\end{equation}
%
0ijk...10 is a closed circuit through the lattice. Any circuit that takes hops between sites 
that aren't connected by the Hamiltonian won't make any contribution to the matrix element
in Eq.~\ref{eq:circuit}. A detailed discussion of the application of the recursion method 
to a surface atom in an idealized cubic lattic is presented in Ref.~\cite{haydock75} 
where a number of the various paths emanating from the starting atom are presented. 

\section{Path Integrals}
There is another (surprisingly direct) connection between the Green's function and 
the path integral formulation of Quantum Mechanics.
This connection is developed in Feynman and Hibbs \cite{feynmanhibbs64}. It is worth
reminding ourselves of the relationship because it provides an excellent mechanical
correspondence that can guide physical intuition.

Classically the action is defined as an integral over the Lagrangian:
%
\begin{equation}
S=\int_{t_{a}}^{t_b} L(\dot{x}, x,t) dt \qquad L = m\dot{x}^{2}-V(x,t)
\end{equation}
%

Feynman then defines the probability of a particle propagating from $a$ to $b$ as:
%
\begin{equation}
G(b,a) = \int_{a}^{b} e^{(i/\hbar)S[b,a]} \mathcal{D}x(t),
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathcal{D}x(t)$ indicates the integral is to be taken over every path from a to b.
Depending on the path taken the contribution of the exponential to the integral will be proportional
to the magnitude of the action S: the paths of least action will give larger contributions 
to the total integral.

Feynman exploits the following equality:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:picompose}
S[2,1] = S[2,3] + S[3,1],
\end{equation}
%
that is we can compose a path between two space time points out of intermediate paths.
Because Eq.~\ref{eq:picompose} is valid for any choice of space-time points $1,2,3$
we can choose infinitesimally spaced points in time, $t$ and $t+\epsilon$, 

From these consideration we can work out a differential equation governing
$G(b,a)$. This differential equation turns out to be the Schr\"odinger equation.
Given a full basis set we can expand G(b,a):
The probability of a particle propagating from a space-time point $a$ to a space time point
$b$ is then written in terms of the eigenstates and eigen energies of the appropriate Hamiltonian:
%
\begin{equation}
G(b,a) = \sum_{n} \phi_{n}(b)\phi_{n}^{*}(a)e^{iE(t_b - t_a)} \qquad t_b>t_a
\end{equation}
%
This formulation will be revisted when we discuss the $GW$ approximation in Chapter~\ref{chap:GW}.

The equivalence of Eq.~\ref{eq:greenschro} and Eq.~\ref{eq:PI} leads us to the fundamental relationship:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:PI}
	\int_{a}^{b} e^{(i/\hbar)S[b,a]} \mathcal{D}x(t) = \sum_{n} \phi_{n}(b)\phi_{n}^{*}(a)e^{iE(t_b - t_a)} = G(b,a)
\end{equation}
%
To the author it appears there is a great deal of scope for further investigation of Eq.~\ref{eq:PI}. 
It suggests a natural harmony between some of the complex mechanical and thermodynamic problems
which find a natural expression in terms of path integrals and the efficient recursive
strategies we can develop for performing calculations: continued fraction expansions of
path integrals would be a promising avenue of research.

\section{Future Work}
The references provided here and in Vol. 35 demonstrate the impact of
the recursion method already achieved by 1980. Only a small subset of that
work has been referenced here. 
%Trends in surface chemistry were also analyzed by computing
%the heat of adsorption for simple molecules across
%the row of the transition metal series in \cite{haydock78}.

The application of the perturbation theory built on the recursion method 
has been used to study photoemission phenomena \cite{mclean77}
and to compute susceptibilities, see for instance Ref.~\cite{terakura78},
both these applications will be further elaborated on in Chap.~\ref{chap:manybodyrec}.

The conclusion to Haydock's chapter in that volume is interesting in he gives 
prognosis for further work along two lines. 

The first line of research consists of diffusing quantum processes in disordered
solids:
%
\begin{quote}
One of the outstanding problems is that of the Anderson model
of a disordered solid. Here the Hamiltonian is defined statistically and
one would like to transform to a corresponding statistically defined chain where
one could discuss the distributions of various physical quantities.
\end{quote}
%

The second line of inquiry consists of the extension of the recursion method
from a single particle description of electronic structure to a many-body Hamiltonian:
%
\begin{quote}
Finally, the reader may have noticed that the approach of this chapter has been entirely directed
toward independent particle models. However, many-body Hamiltonians must be similarly 
transformable to chain models. Aside from a small amount of thought and continuing interest, 
nothing has been done about this and it remains a most interesting problem concerning recursive 
solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation.
\end{quote}

Since Vol. 35 was published there has been a rise in the accessibility of density functional methods 
and access to good single particle approximations to the electronic eigenstates of a crystal
is routine. Additionally, progress on the problem of determining the localized Wannier functions, 
means tight binding Hamiltonians can be determined unambiguously.

First principles understanding of Green's function methods and their application to the many body
problem have also developed. In the following chapters we will look at how these developments
coupled with recursion techniques can provide a framework for a computationally tractable 
toolkit for performing highly accurate calculations of material properties.

\section{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item (Kwidzinski: Continued Fractions and Classical Vibrations) 
      Let $x_{n}(t)$ be a time dependent function for the position of mass $m$.
      For a one sided infinite chain of coupled harmonic oscillators, with 
      spring constants $k$ and masses $m$ the equations of motion for the $0^{\rm th}$ and
      $n^{th}$ spring can be shown to be:
      %
      \begin{equation}
      (s^{2} + \frac{k_{0}}{m_{0}}) x_{0}(s) - \frac{k_{0}}{m_{0}}x_{1}(s) = As 
      \end{equation}
      %
      and for the $n^{th}$ oscillating mass:
      %
      \begin{equation}
      (s^{2}+\frac{k_{n-1}+k_{n}}{m_{n}})x_{n}(s)-(\frac{k_{n-1}}{m_{n}}x_{n-1}(s) + \frac{k_{n}}{m_{n}}x_{n+1}(s)) = 0
      \end{equation}
      % 
      where $x_{m}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-st}x(t)dt$ is the Laplace transform of the time dependent position.
      Write this system of equations as a matrix where the vectors 
      are $[x_{0}(s), 0, 0, 0,...]^{\rm T}$, $[0, x_{1}(s), 0, 0, ...]^{\rm T}$ etc,
      and use the determinant expansion trick in Eq.~\ref{eq:cauchy} to find a 
      continued fraction expansion for the $x_{0}$ element.
      Simplify this continued fraction to obtain an expression for the Laplace 
      transform of the position operator.
      %
      The time dependence of the position can then be found by performing the inverse Laplace transform
      this can be done most easily by checking a correspondence table
      in an appropriate handbook. (For instance, M. Abramowitz, I. Stegun (1965) 
      Handbook of Mathematical Functions).
      %Should give the first bessel function.
      %For a two sided infinite chain the relevant equations of motion are: 
      %What is the continued fraction expansion for the laplace transform of a mass $n$?
      %What is its form in the time domain?

\item (Haydock: Recursion for a Free Electron) Take the Hamiltonian for a non-relativistic 
free electron in radial coordinates:
%
\begin{equation}
H = \frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left[\frac{d}{dr^{2}}+ \frac{2}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\right]
\end{equation}
%
Now assume an electron has been prepared in an initial state:
%
\begin{equation}
u_{0}=(\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{\pi}})^{3/2} e^{-(\lambda r)^{2}/2}
\end{equation}
%
What are the first coefficients in a continued fraction expansion of the Green's
function $a_{0}$ and $b_{1}$? What is the first vector in the chain $u_{1}$?
Look up the Laguerre polynomials and write down the general 
coefficients $a_{n}$, $b_n$, and the general state $u_{n}$. 
(A convenient unit of energy in this problem is $\frac{\hbar^{2}\lambda^{2}}{2m}$).

Evaluate the infinite sum with the results from part 1 to obtain the eigenstate
of a free electron:
%
\begin{equation}
\psi(r) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}P_{n}(E)u_{n}
\end{equation}
%
What type of function represents the eigenstate of a free electron?

\item (R. Haydock and M.J. Kelly, Surf. Sci. 38, 139 (1973)) 
       Given a body centered cubic crystal with an 
       on site energy $a$ and a nearest neighbour hopping integral
       $b$, what, using a single hop in the recursion method, will be the relative 
       magnitudes of the local density of states 
       at the Fermi energy for a canonical transition metal 
       atom on a $[001]$, $[110]$, and a $[111]$ surface?
       Show that the LDOS is proportional to the square root of the number of neighbours.
       Following the template for the Bulk LDOS use the \texttt{CamRecLib} to compute
       the LDOS spectra for the three different surfaces.

\end{itemize}
