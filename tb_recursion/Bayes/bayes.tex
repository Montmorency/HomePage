\chapter{Macroscopic Materials Properties and Bayesian Modelling}
\label{chap:bayes}
%This paragraph needs research:
%Mention GAP models, empirical pseudopotentials, the lave phase stuff as well.
%Parameters of excitation and structure TB recursions can be updated as well.
%In addition many important theoretical developments came 
%from the context of attempting to explain a new set of experimental data.
%Bethe's calculation of the hyperfine? shift, the recursion work on the magnetic 
%moment of $FeAl_{3}$, I think Bardeen mentioned his work on superconductivity was
%initiated when they were trying, Shockley's work on the transistor. (A good source 
%for these sorts of anecdotal history can be found in Nobel prize banquet speeches.)

\section{Bayesian Model Ranking}
A metric for determining what is meant by a minimal model
can be found in Bayesian probability theory. The Bayesian framework 
lets us define a metric that increases as the number of free 
parameters in the model is reduced, and the reproduction of 
target experimental data is increased, with a bound on optimal predictions.

The posterior on the parameters of the model can be assessed:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bayes}
P(\mathbf{w}|D, \mathcal{H}_{i}) = 
\frac{P(D|\mathbf{w}, \mathcal{H}_{i})P(\mathbf{w}|\mathcal{H})}{P(D|\mathcal{H}_{i})},
\end{equation}
%
where D, the target data, should constitute experimental data. 
Eq.~\ref{eq:bayes} MacKay summarises as:
%
\begin{equation}
{\rm Posterior} = \frac{{\rm Likelihood} \times {\rm Prior}}{{\rm Evidence}}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bayesH}
P(\mathcal{H}_{i}|D) \propto P(D|\mathcal{H}_{i})P(\mathcal{H}_{i})
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bayesH}
P(D|\mathcal{H}_{i}) = \int P(D|\mathbf{w}, \mathcal{H}_{i})P(\mathbf{w}|\mathcal{H}_{i})d\mathbf{w}
\end{equation}
%
Models (hypotheses) of material systems can then be ranked according to Eq.~\ref{eq:bayesH},
