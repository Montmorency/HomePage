\section{Introduction}
Once, when traveling, I arrived at Heathrow airport quite late. My
plane had been delayed and it was some while after midnight that I 
finally made it to the front of the queue at customs. I was working
in England at the time and required a visa to enter the country.
The visa meant answering a standard battery of questions each
time I returned from abroad. I will reproduce one particular exchange 
with Heathrow's border security in full:

"How do you qualify for this visa?"

"Maternal Grandmother."

"Where do you work?"

"In a materials science department."

"What do you do?"

"Research."

"What in particular?"

"Materials science."

"What is that?"

"Well, I suppose it is the physics of condensed matter or the physics of the solid state."

At this point the man questioning me stopped and looked up from his computer. 

"There are no solids.", he said, "only space and energy." He then 
chuckled, returned my passport, and told me I was free to enter the country.

To this day I don't know if he was joking or not. I suspect not. 
I am of the opinion that there is an english border guard of asian descent, possibly retired now, 
with a deeper intuitive sense of the secrets of the material universe than most professors
of the subject.

Perhaps being jealous of the calm certainty with which the guard
commanded the subject I thought it might be appropriate for me
to develop my own ideas of what exactly material science constitutes.

First some bad news. I am afraid that the discussion still requires a fair amount of mathematical formalism
to be introduced. The economy of expression afforded by mathematics can't be beaten. 
Most of the mathematics will be fairly accessible to anyone who has studied
calculus and linear algebra. I am of the opinion though that anyone patient enough and
with sufficient cross referencing and study of the diagrams will be able to follow the mathematical
arguments reproduced here regardless of their level of mathematical training.

The good news is that there will be pictures. Wherever there is alot of math there 
should be a picture that captures, schematically, the essential ideas which are being discussed. 
It turns out that for most of materials science the most important pictures always seem to be ones showing you
how atoms are arranged in space, and graphs showing you where a resonance is likely to occur. 
Resonances in the equations are what we relate to experimental probes.
The absorption and emission of light (photoabsorption and photoemission) by materials is how 
we infer details about a materials atomic structure and electronic properties. 
In a strict sense of the words we shine light on materials to try to understand how they work. 

\section{Electronic Structure for Materials Science}

In 1987 Henry Ehrenreich published an article in Science called
"Electronic Theory for Materials Science". The article begins
with what might now be considered a bold statement:

\begin{quote}
Theoretical Materials Science remains to be invented as a discipline, and for good reason.
\end{quote}

The reason he supplies is that materials processing, historically, was a craft. 
A roman engineer knew that a pinch of gypsum could significantly impact 
the properties of the concrete produced. A blacksmith learned that swords and shields were 
effected by the alloying of the metals and careful control of heat: 
firing the blade then quenching the blade in cold water.

These two proposition seem to be at odds.

Ehrenreich posits four points about what priorities and constraints shape 
the field of material science:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item i) theory must be closely linked to experiment.
\item ii) ab initio calculations without approximations are virtually impossible except in model systems.
\item iii) approximations are frequently based on prior experience rather than on theoretical justification.
\item iv) the study of trends in the properties of homologous materials is a crucial ingredient of a credible theoretical framework.
\end{itemize}
%

This paper was written in 1987. It is worth considering how the intervening
30 years may have adjusted some of these priorities. Start with point (ii). The constant development
of computing capacity and computer programs means that ab initio calculations
are now standard. The methodological developments underpinning this, 
largely density functional theory, pseudopotentials, various numerical algorithms
for computing the eigenstates of electrons in material systems and standardized 
computational packages for performing these calculations did not exist in their
present state. Looking at the citation metrics, foundational papers in the subject
of DFT and methods number their citations in the tens of thousands,for the 
theoretical and algorithmic improvements improvements are sufficient testament 
to the reach and fundamental nature of ab initio calculations.

The cost of the ubiquity of access to {\it ab initio} data has had a significant impact on 
point (i). Cursory surveys of the literature demonstrate the frequency
of publications which contain no original experimental work. 

This is partly down to the high level of specialization of 
contemporary researchers and research groups. Previously the distinction between
an experimental materials scientist and theoretical one was not so dramatic. 
In addition many important theoretical developments came 
from the context of attempting to explain a particular new set of experimental data.

Perhaps most famously the emission spectra of hydrogen and the Michelson-Morley 
experiment motivated developments in quantum theory and special relativity.
Subsequent theoretical developments follow the same pattern.
Bethe's calculation of the lamb shift. The recursion work on the magnetic 
moment of $FeAl_{3}$ are two specific examples that come to mind.

\section{Electron Waves in Materials}
That waves diffract is essential to understanding their properties 
and if we have electron waves in a material we are going to have them
interfering and piling up on each other.

When the wavelength of an electron in a crystal:
%
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \hbar/\k,
\end{equation}
%
is comparable to the inter atomic distance $a$ there is going to be diffraction.
A lot of theoretical condensed matter physics, and increasingly applied materials science,
is concerned with calculating the way electrons scatter off of atomic sites. 
These diffracted waves result in the piling up of electronic charge in different regions of space
in crystals. The problem is additionally complicated because the electron 
waves also need to scatter off each other.
