\section{Introduction}
In 1987 Henry Ehrenreich published an article in science called
Electronic Theory for Materials Science. The article begins
with what might now be considered a bold statement:

Theoretical Materials Science remains to be invented as a discipline,
and for good reason.

The reason he supplies is that materials processing, at least
historically was a craft. A pinch of gypsum here, a dash of nickel 
transforms the quality of concrete or a knight's sword beyond
what one might have any reason to expect. 


An atom is indivisible and unique yet it is difficult to formulate,
mathematically, a description applicable to that same atom in all
its different conformations. An atom as it stands alone is in some
ways completely different from the same atom in a large crystal, 
and again when it has new neighbours.

"The importance of this approach would lie in the fact that
one has a single entity $G_{A}$ to represent an element 
in anything from a small moleculeto a complex alloy."

"What we lack is a fundamental quantum theory of the cohesion and structure
of a wide diversity of solids." 
pg. 34 Heine

So we now have developed two important arguments. Electronic structure
is a theory of the local environment, the effects depend on nearest
neighbours and swapping atoms in and out of a crystal matrix will 
effect local properties but not general ones. Secondly, 
tiny variations in the material composition
produce dramatic effects across lengths scales completely altering
the properties of the material.

These two proposition seem to be at odds.

On the one hand we have atoms on the other we have extended materials.
Cottrell noted that metallurgy would require a "theory... which explains
the properties of metallic solids and the explanation of the origin of this
structure from the strutures of individual atoms." 

Let's go back to Ehrenreich he posits four interesting points
about what priorities and constraints shape the field of material
science:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item i) theory must be closely linked to experiment
\item ii) ab initio calculations without approximate are virtually impossible except in model systems
\item iii) approximations are frequently based on prior experience rather than on theoretical justification
iv) the study of trends in the properties of homologous materials is a crucial ingredient of a credible theoretical framework.
\end{itemize}

Keep in mind this paper was written in 1987. It is worth considering how the intervening
30 years has rebalanced priorities. Start with point (ii). The constant development
of computing capacity and computer programs means that ab initio calculations
are now standard. The methodological developments underpinning this, 
largely density functional theory, pseudopotentials, various numerical algorithms
for computing the eigenstates of electrons in material systems and standardized 
computational packages for performing these calculations could not have been 
anticipated. Looking at the citation metrics for the theoretical and algorithmic
improvements improvements are sufficient testament to the reach and fundamental
nature of ab initio calculations.

The cost of the uniquity of access to ab initio data has come to point (i) 
and the acceptance of this comes from point (iii). Again cursory surveys of 
the literature, APS journals PRB, J Phys. Cond. Matt. demonstrate the frequency
of publications which contain no original experimental work. The confirmation
of the data. This is partly down to the high level of specialization of 
contemporary researchers and research groups. Previously the distinction between
a surface scientist and theoretician was not so dramatic. In addition many
important theoretical developments came from the context of attempting to explain
a particular new set of experimental data.

Perhaps most famously the emission spectra of hydrogen and the michelson morley 
experiment motivated developments in quantum theory and special relativity.
Subsequent theoretical developments follow the same pattern:
Bethe's calculation of the lamb shift, recursion work on the magnetic moment of FeAl_{3}
are two specific examples that come to mind.
