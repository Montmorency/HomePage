\section{Introduction}
The Slater-Koster scheme \cite{slater54} provides a framework for estimating the numerical value of the large number of complicated 
integrals which appear in matrix elements between Bloch sums. By exploiting a local atom centered basis set, and
neglecting matrix elements between distant atoms, the number of these integrals can be reduced to a manageable form. 
The numerical value of the integrals can then be obtained via a fit to a known band structure or by direct computation. 

The Bloch sums in a local atomic basis set can be written:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tb}
\sum_{\R_{j}} e^{i\k\cdot(\R_{j}-\R_{i})}\times\int \psi^{*}_{n)(\r-\R_{i})H\psi_{m}(\r-\R_{j})dV.
\end{equation}
%
Eq.~\ref{eq:tb} yields the matrix elements arising in the tight binding basis, the eigenvalues can then be obtained
by solving the secular equation.

An alternative scheme is based on the empirical pseudopotential method. In this scheme the valence electrons are considered
to be moving in a smooth potential that can be defined with only a few fourier coefficients. The
coefficients of the potential in this scheme are obtained by a fit to experimental ($\k$-resolved) band structures. 
The emprical pseudopotential scheme has the advantage of providing directly the wavefunctions and eigenvalues 
whereas the tight-binding scheme's purpose is to avoid having to deal directly with the, potentially, 
complicated spatial structure of the wave functions.
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:emp}
\hat{H}_{EMP} = -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^{2} + \sum_{\G}V(\G)e^{-i\G\cdot\r}
\end{equation}
%
Both Hamiltonians commute with the translation operator $\hat{T}$ as they must for Bloch's theorem to apply.

The power of modern day computers is such that full {\it ab initio} methods are now common place for producing bandstructures.
The eigenvectors of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian can be computed directly:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kohnsham}
H = -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^{2} + V^{\rm ion}(\r-\R_{i}) + V^{\rm H}(\r-\R) + V^{\rm xc}(\r)
\end{equation}

These methods are hence reliant on some approximation for the exchange-correlation functional $V^{xc}$. Fortunately,
highly effective approximations to this potential exist. The most common functions are those which interpolate
the exchange-correlation potential of a free electron gas at low, intermediate, and high densities.

In this work we seek alternative parameterizations of the functional based on a combination of 
theoretical and empirical data. To accomplish this we decompose the tight binding and the empirical pseudopotential
into a sum of the exchange correlation potential, the kinetic energy, and then everything else, i.e.
the scattering of the valence electrons due to the atomic cores and the Hartree potential.
The procedure is then as follows: obtain the coefficients of Eq.~\ref{eq:emp} that best match experimental data.
Rotate these wavefunctions in Wannier functions suitable for evaluating the matrix elements in Eq.\ref{tb}.
Subtract the matrix elements of the ionic contribution, the hartree potential, and the kinetic energy leaving only
the exchange correlation part.

The most generaly function that can be considered is:
%
\begin{equation}
E_{ij} - [V^{H} + V^{ion} + \bra|-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^{2}|\ket] = E^{xc}_{ij} = \int w_{i}(\r-\R_{i})\Sigma(\r,\r';\omega)w_{j}(\r'-\R_{i})d\r d\r'
\end{equation}
%

However we will initially work with:
%
\begin{equation}
E_{ij} - [V^{H} + V^{ion} + \bra|-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^{2}|\ket] = E^{xc}_{ij} = \int w_{i}(\r-\R_{i})\frac{\delta E}{\delta[\rho(\r)]}w_{j}(\r-\R_{i}) d\r
\end{equation}
%

The $V^{xc} = \frac{\delta E \delta[\rho[r]]}$ is what we wish to fit. In the current formulation of the 
problem There is an indefinite number of ways to parameterize 
this function so that the required matrix elements are returned. In order to proceed further we need to restrict the
space of functions .

The two function spaces we explore in this work are $Vxc(\r)$ and using a Pade approximant. If we attempt a Pad\'e
fit via the direct inversion of the interpolating matrix we encounter severe problems with the condition number 
of the matrix making the accuracy and uniqueness of the fits difficult to quantify. We lose 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:contfrac}
V^{xc}(\r) = \cfrac{1+}{a_{0}\rho(r) + \cfrac{b_{0}}{a_{1}*\rho(r)+b_{1}}...}
\end{equation}
%
In order for the function to be continuous in the density the poles of the function must lie somewhere in the 
complex plane off the positive real axis. 

We will employ a Bayesian model to obtain the optimal, in a sense we will define more precisely shortly,  
coefficients for Eq.~\ref{eq:contfrac}. The model requires that the coefficients provide an accurate fit 
across the experimental data set, as well as satisfying certain theoretical constraints in the high and low density limits.

First the fits of the potential in Eq.~\ref{eq:emp} will be made for each material. Upon obtaining the wave functions
they will be rotated into a Wannier representation. All the known {\it ab initio} components of the matrix elements
in Eq.~\ref{eq:tb} will be tabulated: i.e., the ionic, Hartree, and kinetic energy matrix elements. the remaining quantity,
$E^{xc}_{ij}$ will then become a target datum to fit the coefficients. For each material the number of target datum
generated will correspond to the number of local basis functions, $N_{\w}$, times the number of $\k$-points for which
we have optical data to hand, $N_{\k}$. The universality of the exchange correlation functional means it is greedy in
terms of the data that can be used to provide constraints on the coeffecients appearing in the expansion.

\section{Empirical Wannier Orbitals}
In Fig.~1 we present the empirical band structures.

\section{Perceptron Exchange Correlation Functionals}
The zeroth order requirement of the perceptron is that it can reproduce the existing parameterizations
of the exchange correlation functional. We can initialize the perceptron with these parameters when
we seek to optimize the experimental exchange correlation functional in Sec.~\ref{sec:bayesvxc}.

\section{Bayesian Fitting of Coefficients}
\label{sec:bayesvxc}
For a given set of weights we can generate trial data, measure the loss with respect to the empirical data,
and then back propagate the weights and biases so that the perceptron is updated. 
In this manner the cost function is minimized and we can obtain our parameterization of the exchange correlation functional.

We note here that the Pad\'e approximation allows us to include experimental uncertainty 
in the target empirical data, and the pseudopotential. These uncertainties can be propagated to the 
parameterization of the functional and marginalized over. For the perceptron we only have the 
log-loss function as an indication of the quality of our final fit.

\section{Results with Fitted Potentials}

\section{Conclusions}
A Bayesian model for obtaining successive approximations to the exchange-correlation functional
has been presented. This approach provides a general metric for the effectiveness of exchange-correlation
functionals in terms of both generality and accuracy. The method is self-propagating in the
sense that more accurate experimental datasets would provide additional and more rigid constraints 
on the weights and biases of the perceptron. The method is not entirely empirical, on the theoretical side
the eigenstates of the crystal and a rigorous mapping procedure through Wannier functions to a local atomic picture
is necessary for fitting the matrix elements of the exchange correlation potential 
according to the Slater-Koster picture. Furthermore the calculation of the kinetic energy, hartree potential, and,
of particular sensitivty, the ionic pseudopotential, are all theoretical constructs.

The formulation in terms of a single particle orbital and 
target matrix elements makes it a well defined inference
problem and all the techniques of that field, including gaussian processes and neural networks, 
will be applicable. The data presented here gives parameterized functionals appropriate to 
sp type free electron systems. However the procedure can be repeated for larger 
datasets in arbitrary materials and there is no need to restrict the fitting 
procedure to optical data. For instance atomic ionization 
energies and electronegativities could be used to provide additional constraints on the 
coefficients in the atomic range of densities, and for transition metals 
cohesive energies, and magnetic data could all be employed. Work in this direction is underway.
