  abstract={The hybrid nearly-free-electron tight-binding first-principle schemes of Hubbard and Jacobs are investigated further, using the Korringa, Kohn and Rostoker equations as starting point. An improved energy-independent model Hamiltonian is presented, which is both more rapidly convergent in reciprocal lattice space and much less sensitive to the choice of splitting parameter than that proposed recently by Hubbard and Dalton. The validity of the approximations made is then tested by calculating the band structures of face-centred cubic copper and iron from first principles. The energy levels of Burdick and Wood are found to be reproduced with a root-mean-square accuracy of better than 0·01 ryd in both cases, with the use of only a 9 × 9 model Hamiltonian matrix. When a hybrid nearly-free-electron tight-binding model Hamiltonian is used as an empirical interpolation scheme, the expressions derived here show explicitly how the parameters describing both the hybridization and the tight-binding overlap integrals may be expressed in 
  terms of only two constants, namely the energy ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsilon.gif] {epsilon} 0 and width Γ of the resonance associated with the d bands.}

  abstract={The structure trend that is observed across the transition metal series as the number of valence electrons N increases 3 to 11 is explained quantitatively. The difference in the total one-electron band structure energy between the close-packed structures face-centred cubic and hexagonal close-packed is shown to determine completely which structure is favoured, whereas an additional hard-core repulsive contribution is necessary when comparing the body-centred cubic and close-packed structures at the noble metal end of the series. The calculations were performed assuming a model transition metal characterized by only the two d-resonance parameters epsilon d and Gamma , from which the densities of states for the three structures were obtained using energy levels calculated by the hybrid nearly- free-electron tight-binding scheme of Pettifor.}

  abstract={The first principle Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker functional and basis functions are transformed directly into the hybrid nearly-free-electron tight binding (H-NFE-TB) form for the case of the transition metals in which the valence electrons behave like virtual bound states or resonances. It is shown that the resulting basis functions are indeed consistent with the NFE-TB picture, because the TB Bloch sums are rapidly convergent over the first few nearest neighbours since the oscillating tails of the resonant wavefunctions have been completely taken care of by the conduction basis set. Further, the H-NFE-TB matrix elements are accurate to second order in the width of the d band and, therefore, contain terms that are directly equivalent to the orthogonality and three-centre integrals of the conventional TB scheme. Finally, the basis functions are orthonormalized and the corresponding energy independent model Hamiltonian presented. The accuracy of this H-NFE-TB representation is illustrated by comparison with the first principle wavefunctions and band structure of iron.}

  abstract={The energy bands of the 4d transition metal series are computed self-consistently within the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) over a range where the volume changes by nearly an order of magnitude about the equilibrium atomic volume. The parameters defining the position and width of the s and d bands are tabulated across the series and as a function of volume. A theoretical interpretation of the trends gives a more detailed understanding of the electronic structure of transition metals. The bottom of the conduction band is accurately described by an Ashcroft empty core pseudopotential. The centre of the d band is fitted very well by an exponential, and the width approximately satisfies Heine's inverse five-thirds volume dependence. The d band occupancy to the left of the series is very sensitive to the relative ion core volume which Duthie and Pettifor show as explaining the rare earth crystal structure trend. The ASA includes explicitly the very important bonding d charge in addition to the usual renormalized atom contribution.}

The internal Fermi levels are estimated from a survey of band structure calculations. They have been checked using a theorem which relates the pressure on a solid to the wavefunctions, their derivatives and energies at the Wigner-Seitz cell boundary. This theorem represents a generalization of a relation previously derived using statistical theory, which was used to provide an independent check on internal Fermi levels in simple metals by imposing the equilibrium, zero pressure condition. Reasonable agreement between band structure and pressure cell-boundary estimates for the transition metal internal Fermi level was obtained. The surface dipole barriers range from 0.2-0.44 Ryd (2.5-6 eV). Their large magnitude is a reflection of the large cell boundary electron densities for these metals.}

Susceptibilities with and without the EPME and an energy change associated with a second derivative of

pointed out that the EPME is very important in producing phonon anomalies and an energy change Delta E 2 can 
enhance them. A discussion from a local bond point of view is also given to elucidate the basic role of the 
EPME. This argument suggests that the positions of phonon anomalies may be rather insensitive to the choice of parameters.}

A simple theory based on the Anderson model is presented to explain the asymmetry in the local density of states (DOS) of s and p symmetry in a d band metal. A prescription is given for calculating the parameters in the Anderson model from first principles and some simple example calculations are carried out to illustrate AR. An antiresonance (AR) dip position in a local DOS at a given site is quite insensitive to a change in the potential at the site, while the d band at the surrounding sites is shifted due to the potential change. It is pointed out that this shift of the d band results in AR in a generalised phase shift Delta N L , that is, a change in the number of occupied states due to the potential change. The significance of AR in Delta N L in several phenomena is discussed.}

The identification of the two relaxation processes observed by Lehto (1977) with specific 2s states has been made by experiments with transient excitation. Four long-lived hole states in B-doped Si have been seen, and slow relaxation from excited acceptor states associated with the p 1/2 band, located in the continuum of the p 3/2 band, have been observed. Transient impurity band conduction having a time dependence closely related to the populations of the 2s A 1 and 2s T 1 +E states has been observed, strongly suggesting that this phenomenon is due simply to the occupation of these states and that many low temperature properties of semiconductors may be due to long-lived excited impurity states.}

  abstract={Within the recursion method, the local density of states is estimated from a truncated continued fraction (Jacobi matrix). For simple one- and two-band models, the authors compare the two methods for calculating the density of states. The quadrature method assumes no information other than the truncated fraction. Given exact band edges in addition to the truncated fraction, an analytic terminator can do better than quadrature if the internal singularities are sufficiently weak.}

  abstract={A general method is presented for approximating continuous densities of states, and wavefunctions over infinite regions, within the recursion method by means of a terminator which is an infinite set of approximate basis states and their Hamiltonian matrix elements. This is an analytical and computational solution to the problem of approximating the projected density of states for a Hamiltonian having an arbitrary number of bands with van Hove singularities. It also enables calculation of charge densities and other quantities related to the wavefunctions. The method is applied to many-band problems. Criteria are developed for the convergence of densities of states, and the asymptotic convergence of the terminator is related to singularities in the spectrum.}

  abstract={We present the generalization of the recursion method of Haydock and co-workers to systems of many interacting particles. 
This new method has close similarities to the memory function or Mori formalism, but with some important differences. 
Heisenberg's equation for the time evolution of a microscopic operator is recursively transformed into a tridiagonal matrix equation. 
This equation resolves the operator into components corresponding to transitions of different energies. The projected spectrum of transitions has a continued fraction expansion given by the elements of the tridiagonal matrix. We show that for an appropriate choice of inner product this density of transitions obeys a generalization of the black body theorem of electromagnetism, in that it is exponentially insensitive to distant parts of the system. This implies that the projected density of transitions is computationally stable and can be calculated even in macroscopic many-body systems. We argue that the physical content of the density of transitions is determined by the nature of its singular points, such as discrete transitions, continuous spectrum, band edges and van Hove singularities.}

If G1 and G2 are the resolvents for media 1 and 2, respectively, and Gs is the re-solvent for a system consisting of 1 and 2 in contact through an interface (not necessarily abrupt), then Gs is fully obtained in terms of G1 and G2. By taking suitable matrix elements one obtains: (i) a secular determinant for the matching eigenvalues (surface states); (ii) a for-mula for the wavefunction everywhere, and (iii) a formula for the density of states. The case of a film is studied in the same way. The formalism is illustrated with a few examples. This paper deals with the physical information contained in the matrix elements of Gs between points which are either on the surface or else on the same side, but the method yields also the matrix elements across the surface, which are important for the theory of dielectric responses in a system with an interface.},

abstract={The theory of excited electronic states is central to a quantitative understanding of the interaction between light and matter and hence to calculations of various x-ray and optical spectra. Although ground state properties are well described by density functional theory (DFT), that theory is inappropriate for excited states, for which a fully quantitative theory has yet to be developed. No one has contributed more to than Lars Hedin to the quest for such a theory. Here we briefly review a number of his key contributions. One of the most influential is the "GW" approximation for the self-energy of an excited electron. Another is the "blue-electron" approximation for photon and electron spectroscopies. A third, which is relevant to the topics of this conference, is a many-body theory of x-ray spectra based on the "quasi-boson" approximation. This approach is a generalization of the GW approximation which takes into account both extrinsic and intrinsic losses as well as the interference between them, and simplifies the treatment of losses and the core-hole interaction. What makes Hedin's theories stand out is their mathematical elegance and physical robustness, based on ideas conceived before their full implementation was practical. With today's advances in computational power, however, the impact of Lars' work is becoming ever more widely appreciated.}

  abstract={The apparent suppression of plasmon satellites in core-level photoemission at low electron kinetic energy is studied. The process of photoemission is studied in the Golden Rule formulation, and the final-state wavefunction corresponding to the photoemitted electron leaving a plasmon excited in the solid is found using perturbation theory. It is found that interference between intrinsic and extrinsic excitation suppresses the long-wavelength surface and bulk plasmon excitation, but the shorter-wavelength plasmons are still excited even at low electron kinetic energies. However the satellites are featureless and are probably lost in the background until the electron kinetic energy is about 40 eV, with parameters appropriate to Al. Subtracting the featureless 'background', total satellite intensities of 14% for the surface plasmons and 31% for the bulk plasmons are obtained, at an electron kinetic energy of 100 eV.}

  abstract={The maximum entropy (ME) method has been compared with the square root terminator (SRT) and Gaussian quadrature (GQ) methods, and some variants of them, for the calculation of tight-binding bond energies based on the recursion method. It is found that with a reasonable estimate of the band edges, preferably too wide rather than too narrow a band, There is no generally preferable method from the point of view of how accurately the exact bond energies are reproduced with from three to six recursion levels. The ME methods are more stable if the chosen bandwidth is too great, but are no better than the SRT methods for too narrow a band. The ME densities of states have a simple analytic form, readily integrated by standard real integration packages. There are numerical difficulties in integrating the SRT densities of states from the band edges, but these can be overcome by contour integration, which avoids the square root singularities. A disadvantage of the ME methods is their extra computational cost and numerical problems for higher numbers of levels (moments). For calculating relative structural energies, the GO method is superior to either of the others for more than five recursion levels. Overall, the SRT method looks the least useful of the three for applications to atomistic relaxation.}

  abstract={The problem of understanding AB 2 transition metal alloy structural trends within the three Laves phases is approached by considering a common-band model alloy. Tight-binding d band densities of states are calculated for the three phases by the recursion method of Haydock, Heine and Kelly (1972). The three total densities of states are very similar, highly peaked structures. The A site local densities of states show a division into bonding and antibonding states. Cohesive energies are computed and it is found that their differences undergo a cyclic variation across the band, which is related to the moments of the densities of states, and hence to the layer stacking of the structures.}

abstract = { Abstract Calculations of the vibrational spectra of continuous random network models of tetrahedrally bonded amorphous semiconductors are presented. Nearest neighbour central and non-central force constants are used. The results show that the shape of the TO-like peak of the spectrum depends on both the topology and bondangle distribution of the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests that a-Ge contains slightly fewer odd-membered rings than the Polk model and an average bond-angle distortion of 10° or more. On the other hand the shape of the TA-like peak depends more directly on the topology of the network, giving a clearer distinction between the results for structures containing both odd and evenmembered rings and those containing even rings only. Tentative comparison with experimental data for a-GaAs suggests a structure containing very few oddmembered rings, while the data for a-Ge indicate a significant number of oddmembered rings. }

Introducing a small distortion characteristic to C 44 (or C') elastic deformation and calculating the energy change up to second order in the atomic displacement, the authors determine the shear elastic constants C 44 and C'. The elastic constants C 11 and C 12 are then calculated by using the relations B= 1 / 3 (C 11 +2C 12 ) and C'= 1 / 2 (C 11 -C 12 ), where B is the bulk modulus. In general, the agreement between the present results and the experimental values is satisfactory. The characteristic elasticity behaviour, i.e. the strong N d (number of d electrons) dependence of the observed anisotropy factor A=C 44 /C', is also discussed.}

  abstract={The method of recurrence relations allows one to calculate time dependent correlation functions from first principles. It originates from the Kubo scalar product which realizes abstract Hilbert space of dynamical variables. For this realized space, we show that there exists a unique orthogonalization process by recurrence relation. The method of recurrence relations exploits geometric properties of the structure of the realized Hilbert space such as the dimensionality and shape. These geometric properties depend on models as well as static constraints, e.g., temperature, wave vector, size. This method has been applied to several physical models including the homogeneous dense electron gas, the spin-1/2 XY and transverse Ising models, the spin van der Waals model and others. For these models, we have obtained the relaxation function, response function and memory function.}

abstract = "The Block Recursion Library, a collection of FORTRAN subroutines, calculates submatrices of the resolvent of a linear operator.
The resolvent, in matrix theory, is a powerful tool for extracting information about solutions of linear systems. The routines use the block
recursion method and achieve high accuracy for very large systems of coupled equations. This technique is a generalization of the scalar
recursion method, an accurate technique for finding the local density of states. A sample program uses these routines to find the quantum
mechanical transmittance of a randomly disordered two-dimensional cluster of atoms."

Hermitian matrix, ƒ and g are column vectors and E is a scalar variable. When ƒ = g the Lanczos algorithm (in the context of the recursion
method) provides an effective means of solution, but for ƒ ≠ g some modifications are needed. In this paper we discuss the use of block
Lanczos iteration to block tridiagonalise H and examine used to calculate projections of the operator matrix form of orthogonal polynomials
and continued fractions. These are used to calculate projections of the operator (EI−H)−1) onto a subspace including ƒ and g (and any other
vectors of interest) and hence to estimate the matrix resolvent elements."
