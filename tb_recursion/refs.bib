  abstract={Within the recursion method, the local density of states is estimated from a truncated continued fraction (Jacobi matrix). For simple one- and two-band models, the authors compare the two methods for calculating the density of states. The quadrature method assumes no information other than the truncated fraction. Given exact band edges in addition to the truncated fraction, an analytic terminator can do better than quadrature if the internal singularities are sufficiently weak.}

  abstract={A general method is presented for approximating continuous densities of states, and wavefunctions over infinite regions, within the recursion method by means of a terminator which is an infinite set of approximate basis states and their Hamiltonian matrix elements. This is an analytical and computational solution to the problem of approximating the projected density of states for a Hamiltonian having an arbitrary number of bands with van Hove singularities. It also enables calculation of charge densities and other quantities related to the wavefunctions. The method is applied to many-band problems. Criteria are developed for the convergence of densities of states, and the asymptotic convergence of the terminator is related to singularities in the spectrum.}

  abstract={We present the generalization of the recursion method of Haydock and co-workers to systems of many interacting particles. 
This new method has close similarities to the memory function or Mori formalism, but with some important differences. 
Heisenberg's equation for the time evolution of a microscopic operator is recursively transformed into a tridiagonal matrix equation. 
This equation resolves the operator into components corresponding to transitions of different energies. The projected spectrum of transitions has a continued fraction expansion given by the elements of the tridiagonal matrix. We show that for an appropriate choice of inner product this density of transitions obeys a generalization of the black body theorem of electromagnetism, in that it is exponentially insensitive to distant parts of the system. This implies that the projected density of transitions is computationally stable and can be calculated even in macroscopic many-body systems. We argue that the physical content of the density of transitions is determined by the nature of its singular points, such as discrete transitions, continuous spectrum, band edges and van Hove singularities.}

If G1 and G2 are the resolvents for media 1 and 2, respectively, and Gs is the re-solvent for a system consisting of 1 and 2 in contact through an interface (not necessarily abrupt), then Gs is fully obtained in terms of G1 and G2. By taking suitable matrix elements one obtains: (i) a secular determinant for the matching eigenvalues (surface states); (ii) a for-mula for the wavefunction everywhere, and (iii) a formula for the density of states. The case of a film is studied in the same way. The formalism is illustrated with a few examples. This paper deals with the physical information contained in the matrix elements of Gs between points which are either on the surface or else on the same side, but the method yields also the matrix elements across the surface, which are important for the theory of dielectric responses in a system with an interface.},

abstract={The theory of excited electronic states is central to a quantitative understanding of the interaction between light and matter and hence to calculations of various x-ray and optical spectra. Although ground state properties are well described by density functional theory (DFT), that theory is inappropriate for excited states, for which a fully quantitative theory has yet to be developed. No one has contributed more to than Lars Hedin to the quest for such a theory. Here we briefly review a number of his key contributions. One of the most influential is the "GW" approximation for the self-energy of an excited electron. Another is the "blue-electron" approximation for photon and electron spectroscopies. A third, which is relevant to the topics of this conference, is a many-body theory of x-ray spectra based on the "quasi-boson" approximation. This approach is a generalization of the GW approximation which takes into account both extrinsic and intrinsic losses as well as the interference between them, and simplifies the treatment of losses and the core-hole interaction. What makes Hedin's theories stand out is their mathematical elegance and physical robustness, based on ideas conceived before their full implementation was practical. With today's advances in computational power, however, the impact of Lars' work is becoming ever more widely appreciated.}

  abstract={The apparent suppression of plasmon satellites in core-level photoemission at low electron kinetic energy is studied. The process of photoemission is studied in the Golden Rule formulation, and the final-state wavefunction corresponding to the photoemitted electron leaving a plasmon excited in the solid is found using perturbation theory. It is found that interference between intrinsic and extrinsic excitation suppresses the long-wavelength surface and bulk plasmon excitation, but the shorter-wavelength plasmons are still excited even at low electron kinetic energies. However the satellites are featureless and are probably lost in the background until the electron kinetic energy is about 40 eV, with parameters appropriate to Al. Subtracting the featureless 'background', total satellite intensities of 14% for the surface plasmons and 31% for the bulk plasmons are obtained, at an electron kinetic energy of 100 eV.}

  abstract={The maximum entropy (ME) method has been compared with the square root terminator (SRT) and Gaussian quadrature (GQ) methods, and some variants of them, for the calculation of tight-binding bond energies based on the recursion method. It is found that with a reasonable estimate of the band edges, preferably too wide rather than too narrow a band, There is no generally preferable method from the point of view of how accurately the exact bond energies are reproduced with from three to six recursion levels. The ME methods are more stable if the chosen bandwidth is too great, but are no better than the SRT methods for too narrow a band. The ME densities of states have a simple analytic form, readily integrated by standard real integration packages. There are numerical difficulties in integrating the SRT densities of states from the band edges, but these can be overcome by contour integration, which avoids the square root singularities. A disadvantage of the ME methods is their extra computational cost and numerical problems for higher numbers of levels (moments). For calculating relative structural energies, the GO method is superior to either of the others for more than five recursion levels. Overall, the SRT method looks the least useful of the three for applications to atomistic relaxation.}

The equations for the Green functions are confined to a finite-cluster region and the influence of the rest of the region appears as a surface potential. The herglotz properties are satisfied in the approximation. They illustrate the methodology by applying it to a binary distribution of spherically symmetric wells in a coherent jellium. This is the alloy generalisation of the impurity work of Inglesfield.}
