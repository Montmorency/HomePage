  abstract={The energy bands of the 4d transition metal series are computed self-consistently within the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) over a range where the volume changes by nearly an order of magnitude about the equilibrium atomic volume. The parameters defining the position and width of the s and d bands are tabulated across the series and as a function of volume. A theoretical interpretation of the trends gives a more detailed understanding of the electronic structure of transition metals. The bottom of the conduction band is accurately described by an Ashcroft empty core pseudopotential. The centre of the d band is fitted very well by an exponential, and the width approximately satisfies Heine's inverse five-thirds volume dependence. The d band occupancy to the left of the series is very sensitive to the relative ion core volume which Duthie and Pettifor show as explaining the rare earth crystal structure trend. The ASA includes explicitly the very important bonding d charge in addition to the usual renormalized atom contribution.}

  abstract={Surface dipole barriers for transition metals have been deduced using calculated internal Fermi levels and experimental electron workfunctions. The internal Fermi levels are estimated from a survey of band structure calculations. They have been checked using a theorem which relates the pressure on a solid to the wavefunctions, their derivatives and energies at the Wigner-Seitz cell boundary. This theorem represents a generalization of a relation previously derived using statistical theory, which was used to provide an independent check on internal Fermi levels in simple metals by imposing the equilibrium, zero pressure condition. Reasonable agreement between band structure and pressure cell-boundary estimates for the transition metal internal Fermi level was obtained. The surface dipole barriers range from 0.2-0.44 Ryd (2.5-6 eV). Their large magnitude is a reflection of the large cell boundary electron densities for these metals.}

compounds due to d-band effects are analysed in detail by using a simple model proposed by Gale and Pettifor (1977). 
Susceptibilities with and without the EPME and an energy change associated with a second derivative of 
hopping integrals, Delta E 2 , are calculated by using Haydock et al.'s (1972, 1975) recursion method. It is 
pointed out that the EPME is very important in producing phonon anomalies and an energy change Delta E 2 can 
enhance them. A discussion from a local bond point of view is also given to elucidate the basic role of the 
EPME. This argument suggests that the positions of phonon anomalies may be rather insensitive to the choice of parameters.}

  abstract={The electronic structure of d band metals and alloys is studied by using the concept of the Fano effect which is commonly used in solid state optics. A simple theory based on the Anderson model is presented to explain the asymmetry in the local density of states (DOS) of s and p symmetry in a d band metal. A prescription is given for calculating the parameters in the Anderson model from first principles and some simple example calculations are carried out to illustrate AR. An antiresonance (AR) dip position in a local DOS at a given site is quite insensitive to a change in the potential at the site, while the d band at the surrounding sites is shifted due to the potential change. It is pointed out that this shift of the d band results in AR in a generalised phase shift Delta N L , that is, a change in the number of occupied states due to the potential change. The significance of AR in Delta N L in several phenomena is discussed.}

  abstract={Several novel experiments using the method of delayed breakdown (Lehto and Proctor 1977) have been made. The identification of the two relaxation processes observed by Lehto (1977) with specific 2s states has been made by experiments with transient excitation. Four long-lived hole states in B-doped Si have been seen, and slow relaxation from excited acceptor states associated with the p 1/2 band, located in the continuum of the p 3/2 band, have been observed. Transient impurity band conduction having a time dependence closely related to the populations of the 2s A 1 and 2s T 1 +E states has been observed, strongly suggesting that this phenomenon is due simply to the occupation of these states and that many low temperature properties of semiconductors may be due to long-lived excited impurity states.}

This potential, which is energy-dependent and non-local, can be found from the Green function for the bulk substrate. The results are based on a variational principle which gives the energy of a state in terms of the wavefunction in I. The embedded Schrodinger equation can be solved by a basis set expansion, for the wavefunctions of discrete states and the Green function in the continuum, and the method is demonstrated for the case of a square well.}

  abstract={We present the generalization of the recursion method of Haydock and co-workers to systems of many interacting particles. 
This new method has close similarities to the memory function or Mori formalism, but with some important differences. 
Heisenberg's equation for the time evolution of a microscopic operator is recursively transformed into a tridiagonal matrix equation. 
This equation resolves the operator into components corresponding to transitions of different energies. The projected spectrum of transitions has a continued fraction expansion given by the elements of the tridiagonal matrix. We show that for an appropriate choice of inner product this density of transitions obeys a generalization of the black body theorem of electromagnetism, in that it is exponentially insensitive to distant parts of the system. This implies that the projected density of transitions is computationally stable and can be calculated even in macroscopic many-body systems. We argue that the physical content of the density of transitions is determined by the nature of its singular points, such as discrete transitions, continuous spectrum, band edges and van Hove singularities.}

abstract = {The matching of the wavefunction at an arbitrary surface is formulated in terms of Green functions. If G1 and G2 are the resolvents for media 1 and 2, respectively, and Gs is the re-solvent for a system consisting of 1 and 2 in contact through an interface (not necessarily abrupt), then Gs is fully obtained in terms of G1 and G2. By taking suitable matrix elements one obtains: (i) a secular determinant for the matching eigenvalues (surface states); (ii) a for-mula for the wavefunction everywhere, and (iii) a formula for the density of states. The case of a film is studied in the same way. The formalism is illustrated with a few examples. This paper deals with the physical information contained in the matrix elements of Gs between points which are either on the surface or else on the same side, but the method yields also the matrix elements across the surface, which are important for the theory of dielectric responses in a system with an interface.},

abstract={The theory of excited electronic states is central to a quantitative understanding of the interaction between light and matter and hence to calculations of various x-ray and optical spectra. Although ground state properties are well described by density functional theory (DFT), that theory is inappropriate for excited states, for which a fully quantitative theory has yet to be developed. No one has contributed more to than Lars Hedin to the quest for such a theory. Here we briefly review a number of his key contributions. One of the most influential is the "GW" approximation for the self-energy of an excited electron. Another is the "blue-electron" approximation for photon and electron spectroscopies. A third, which is relevant to the topics of this conference, is a many-body theory of x-ray spectra based on the "quasi-boson" approximation. This approach is a generalization of the GW approximation which takes into account both extrinsic and intrinsic losses as well as the interference between them, and simplifies the treatment of losses and the core-hole interaction. What makes Hedin's theories stand out is their mathematical elegance and physical robustness, based on ideas conceived before their full implementation was practical. With today's advances in computational power, however, the impact of Lars' work is becoming ever more widely appreciated.}

The method is applied to several surfaces of copper and the results are compared with recent experiments. The determination of electronic structure for adsorbates is discussed, along with comments on the accuracy of current models of clean metal surfaces.}

abstract = { Abstract Calculations of the vibrational spectra of continuous random network models of tetrahedrally bonded amorphous semiconductors are presented. Nearest neighbour central and non-central force constants are used. The results show that the shape of the TO-like peak of the spectrum depends on both the topology and bondangle distribution of the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests that a-Ge contains slightly fewer odd-membered rings than the Polk model and an average bond-angle distortion of 10° or more. On the other hand the shape of the TA-like peak depends more directly on the topology of the network, giving a clearer distinction between the results for structures containing both odd and evenmembered rings and those containing even rings only. Tentative comparison with experimental data for a-GaAs suggests a structure containing very few oddmembered rings, while the data for a-Ge indicate a significant number of oddmembered rings. }

  abstract={A cluster theory based on the continued fraction method has been used for the density of states of the d electrons in Cu-Ni alloys. No s-d hybridisation has been taken into account and the tight-binding hopping matrix elements used in the computations have been derived from existing values of the Slater-Koster parameters for the alloy. The results show that, while the method gives a majority band less detailed than in CPA computations the structure of the minority band of Ni, smeared out by CPA, is well reproduced.}
