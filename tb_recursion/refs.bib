abstract={The question of atomic and electronic structure of grain boundaries in Si is addressed within the tight-binding approximation with a self-consistent charge neutrality condition. The authors use simultaneous recursion in real space to calculate inter-atomic forces and relax reconstructions of Sigma =3(112) and Sigma =5(130) grain boundaries. Consequences of over- and under-coordination at defects are illustrated, and relaxed atomic structures are compared with recent lattice imaging and electron diffraction experiments.}

  abstract={We present the generalization of the recursion method of Haydock and co-workers to systems of many interacting particles. 
This new method has close similarities to the memory function or Mori formalism, but with some important differences. 
Heisenberg's equation for the time evolution of a microscopic operator is recursively transformed into a tridiagonal matrix equation. 
This equation resolves the operator into components corresponding to transitions of different energies. The projected spectrum of transitions has a continued fraction expansion given by the elements of the tridiagonal matrix. We show that for an appropriate choice of inner product this density of transitions obeys a generalization of the black body theorem of electromagnetism, in that it is exponentially insensitive to distant parts of the system. This implies that the projected density of transitions is computationally stable and can be calculated even in macroscopic many-body systems. We argue that the physical content of the density of transitions is determined by the nature of its singular points, such as discrete transitions, continuous spectrum, band edges and van Hove singularities.}

abstract = {The matching of the wavefunction at an arbitrary surface is formulated in terms of Green functions. If G1 and G2 are the resolvents for media 1 and 2, respectively, and Gs is the re-solvent for a system consisting of 1 and 2 in contact through an interface (not necessarily abrupt), then Gs is fully obtained in terms of G1 and G2. By taking suitable matrix elements one obtains: (i) a secular determinant for the matching eigenvalues (surface states); (ii) a for-mula for the wavefunction everywhere, and (iii) a formula for the density of states. The case of a film is studied in the same way. The formalism is illustrated with a few examples. This paper deals with the physical information contained in the matrix elements of Gs between points which are either on the surface or else on the same side, but the method yields also the matrix elements across the surface, which are important for the theory of dielectric responses in a system with an interface.},
